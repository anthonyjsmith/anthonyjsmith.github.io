_Christian. Soon to be CofE ordinand in Durham. Previous lives: organist, [astronomer](http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/astronomy/), [software developer](http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/software/). Married, [green](/2011/09/13/why-would-a-christian-join-the-green-party/), [singer](/singing/)._

<img alt="Me" title="Me" src="/assets/me.jpg" class="alignleft">Until the summer of 2016, I worked in [computer software](http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/software/). Previously I was a university researcher in [astronomy](http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/astronomy/), but that drifted towards astronomical computer software, and then I moved into freelance web development. I also spent a fair bit of time trying to support Christian postgraduate students in Liverpool and elsewhere (partly through involvement in [Faith-in-Scholarship](http://wysocs.org.uk/faith-in-scholarship) and [Transforming the Mind](http://christianpostgrad.org.uk/content/node/34)).

I bought this domain name back in 2002, and haven't yet persuaded myself to give it up. Initially it was just a few static (and tasteless) HTML pages with a bit about myself and lots of links, but [it became a non-blog on 24 April 2006]({% post_url 2006-04-24-ceci-nest-pas-un-blog %}) (using WordPress). I don't have a particular purpose for the (non-)blog, but I enjoy writing from time to time, and I like to delude myself into thinking that I have something worthwhile to say. I tend to focus on Christian-related topics, but you'll see occasional posts about astronomy, computing, music, green issues, politics, current affairs, random thoughts and random trivia. (Posts of a more technical nature related to astronomy or computing can be found [on my other blog](http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/).) Comments welcome, unless you're a spambot!

Despite having been in church services most weeks for all of my life, by the time I was ten I was a firm atheist and thought this religious stuff was a load of nonsense. But I think I wanted to believe, not least because I was getting very keen on church music and playing the organ. When I was 15 I started going to the youth group of a local Bible-believing church. On 2 March 1996 this church held a youth service. The preacher's text was Luke 9:23: "Then he [Jesus] said to them all: 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.'" He encouraged us to commit our lives to God, and I did so, out of a real sense of God drawing me to himself.

It was quite a radical change, and I now see my life as fitting into God's big story for his whole creation, which is summed up nicely in [this video](http://three-two-one.org/) (embedded below).

It's been a varied journey since that time. Some significant influences on my thinking and spiritual formation, in approximately chronological order, have included: Hitchin Christian Centre, Evangelical Times, Answers in Genesis/Creation Ministries International and Ken Ham, John Stott, Francis Schaeffer, CH Spurgeon, CICCU and UCCF, Cambridge Presbyterian Church and Ian Hamilton, Roger Carswell, [Calvary Evangelical Church (Brighton)](http://www.calvary-brighton.org.uk/) and Philip Wells, [L'Abri](http://www.labri.org/) (England) and Andrew Fellows, Proclamation Trust and Dick Lucas, Larry Crabb, Graeme Goldsworthy, Christopher Wright, Ellis Potter, Mike Reeves, [NT Wright](http://www.ntwrightpage.com/), Word Alive, John Piper, David Field, Henri Blocher, Kurt Wise, [Jubilee Centre](http://www.jubilee-centre.org/), [Andrew Basden](http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/basden.htm), Roy Clouser, Al Wolters, [WYSOCS](http://wysocs.org.uk/) (West Yorkshire School of Christian Studies), Jonathan Chaplin, Stephen Neill, Bob Goudzwaard, James KA Smith, Peter Leithart ... and more!
