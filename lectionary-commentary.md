This is a commentary on the _lectionary_, not a commentary on the _passages_. The aim is to answer the question: _Why was this passage chosen?_

Simply search below for the relevant day, e.g., 'Advent 1', 'Proper 21', 'Bartholomew'.

Most of the comments below are 'reverse engineered' using the lectionary and a fair bit of guesswork, so they should not be taken as authoritative.

Any feedback? Please [contact](/contact/) me!

**_Work in progress!_**

* Year A: complete from Advent 1 to Trinity
* Year B: hardly begun
* Year C: complete from Palm Sunday onwards
* Festivals: complete for January to March, and from September to December

# Introduction {#introduction}

**Common Worship** was introduced in the Church of England in 2000. It includes a [Lectionary for Sundays, Principal Feasts and Holy Days, and Festivals](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary), which provides a lectionary for three services on each of those days: Principal Service, Second Service, and Third Service (along with 'Evening Prayer on the Eve' for some occasions). This page covers the **Principal Service Lectionary**, which is drawn (with modifications) from the ecumenical **Revised Common Lectionary (RCL)**.

Note that there is often no 'theme' tying the readings together. (Many people persist in looking for one, even decades after the ASB.) Where readings are closely related, they are grouped together below. In many cases, however, a particular reading will not be related to other readings on the same day, but it will turn out to be part of a series on a particular book of the Bible running over several weeks. This principle of continuous (or semicontinuous) reading of Scripture is one of the key principles behind the lectionary.

## The Bible and the lectionary

For the Gospels, see the [section below](#gospels) for details. Year A focuses on Matthew, Year B on Mark, and Year C on Luke, while John is read in Years A, B and C, mostly during the seasons (especially Easter), but with some appearances in Ordinary Time in Year B (such as a summer series on John 6).

Acts is read at the Baptism of Christ, between Easter Day and Pentecost (vaguely sequentially), and on some Festivals.

Numerous Psalms are included. To get some idea, see the [Reverse Lectionary](https://www.lectionarypage.net/ReverseLectionary.html#Psalms) for the Episcopal Church's adaptation of the RCL.

Many other books are read semicontinuously, while also featuring in a non-sequential way during seasons and Festivals and as 'Related' Old Testament readings after Trinity.

Old Testament 'Continuous' readings after Trinity cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A (Pentateuch): Genesis, Exodus and Deuteronomy 34
* Year B (History and Wisdom): 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings (up to chapter 8), and selections from Song of Solomon, Proverbs, Esther and Job
* Year C (Prophets): 1 Kings 17 &ndash; 2 Kings 5 (Elijah and Elisha), Amos, Hosea, Isaiah (briefly!), Jeremiah, Lamentations and Joel

New Testament readings after Trinity and before Advent cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A: Romans, Philippians and 1 Thessalonians
* Year B: 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, James and Hebrews 1-10
* Year C: Galatians, Colossians, Hebrews 11-13, Philemon, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and 2 Thessalonians

Other semicontinuous treatments of New Testament books are as follows:

* 1 Corinthians:
  * Year A: chapters 1-3 after Epiphany and in February
  * Year B: chapter 9 for two Sundays in February
  * Year C: chapters 12-13 for two Sundays in Epiphany, followed by chapter 15 for three Sundays in February
* 1 Peter: Easter season, Year A
* 1 John: Easter season, Year B
* Revelation: Easter season, Year C (also three Sundays in Epiphany, Year B, not sequential)

What about those parts of the Bible that are not read sequentially?

* Old Testament
  * Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Jonah, Micah, Zephaniah and Malachi: included, but not in a systematic way
  * Judges, Ruth, Ezra, Obadiah, Nahum and Haggai: not included
  * 1 and 2 Chronicles: not included (outside Festivals)
  * Ecclesiastes, Habakkuk and Zechariah: once as a 'Related' reading
  * Isaiah: features prominently in Advent, Christmas and Epiphany, and at other times (not sequential)
* New Testament
  * Titus: included, but not in a systematic way
  * 2 Peter: included, but not in a systematic way
  * 2 John, 3 John, Jude: not included

## Choosing between the readings

It is worth noting rule 5 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a), which gives permission to extend the readings:

> In a compact cycle of readings such as these, some passages have necessarily been abbreviated. When opportunity allows, the passages may be read in full. Verses in brackets may be included or omitted, as desired.

Each service has the following readings:

* **Old Testament reading** (or sometimes a reading from Acts),
* **psalm or canticle** (usually a response to the first reading),
* **New Testament reading** (from an epistle or Revelation), and
* **Gospel reading**.

The psalm or canticle should normally be used, along with two or three of the other readings. When using just two of the other readings, Common Worship specifies:

> When there are only two readings at the principal service and that service is Holy Communion, the second reading is always the Gospel reading. ...
>
> When the Principal Service Lectionary is used at a service other than Holy Communion, the Gospel reading need not always be chosen.

In addition, when the first reading is from Acts, it must be included as one of the readings.

Note that in Common Worship Holy Communion (Order One or Two), 'Either one or two readings from Scripture precede the Gospel reading', and 'The psalm or canticle follows the first reading'. As the psalm or canticle is usually related to the Old Testament reading, this makes a lot of sense when that reading is used; it makes less sense when the Old Testament reading is omitted, because the psalm or canticle is often unrelated to the New Testament reading.

On the Sundays after Trinity, the Gospel reading and the New Testament reading follow separate tracks, and there are two alternative tracks for the Old Testament reading and the psalm, as explained in Common Worship:

> Those under the heading 'Continuous' allow the Old Testament reading and its complementary psalm to stand independently of the other readings. Those under the heading 'Related' relate the Old Testament reading and the psalm to the Gospel reading.

Those who prefer the readings to cohere can have their wishes partially satisfied by opting for the 'Related' Old Testament reading (and psalm), which is related to the Gospel reading. But the cost of this is that it prevents the Old Testament from speaking so clearly with its own voice, and there is no 'Related' alternative reading from the New Testament.

## Notes

Psalm references are to the Common Worship psalter. Where the versification is different in standard English versions of the Bible, this is indicated by 'EV'. Quotations are drawn from the Common Worship psalter or the NRSV.

Depending on the day of the week for Christmas and Epiphany, and the date of Easter, lectionary provision for days marked with * might not be used in any given year. Other days might also be displaced for various reasons.

# Gospels {#gospels}

The Gospel readings on Sundays during Ordinary Time work semicontinuously through the central portions of Matthew, Mark and Luke. More precisely, this actually begins just before Ordinary Time, in Epiphany 3, with the start of Jesus' public ministry (or at least, it does in the RCL: see notes on Epiphany 3), continuing into February until 3 before Lent, and then the series resumes after Trinity, continuing until the Sunday before Advent. (The one exception is Year B, 3 before Advent, Mark 1.14-20.) Material from Matthew 1:1-4:11, Mark 1:1-13 and Luke 1:1-4:13 is included in Advent, Christmas, Epiphany 1 and Lent (along with extracts from other chapters), and the resurrection accounts are included during Easter. Note that the Passion narratives (Matthew 26-27, Mark 14-15 and Luke 22-23), with one or two small exceptions, are included _only_ on Palm Sunday, within the Liturgy of the Passion.

Details of omitted passages will included further below, but it is worth noting here which passages are included from the opening chapters of Matthew, Mark and Luke. This is also a convenient point to examine in detail how John's Gospel is read.

* Luke 3.23-38: omitted.
* Luke 4.1-13: Lent 1.

**John**

Every year is a 'John year', at least from Christmas to Pentecost (or Trinity), during which the Gospel reading is very often taken from John. Most (73%) of John is covered, with the biggest omissions in chapters 7, 8 and 16. The only readings from John in Ordinary Time are from chapter 6 in Year B (Proper 12 to 16). Each year includes readings taken from the following chapters (more or less):

* Christmas and Epiphany: chapters 1 and 2

# Advent {#advent}

## Advent 1

The Gospel readings all speak of the 'coming' of 'the Son of Man'.

Year A

* **Matthew 24.36-44** urges us to 'be ready' for 'the coming of the Son of Man'. **Romans 13.11-14** is an exhortation to 'lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light' because 'the day is near'. **Isaiah 2.1-5** begins a series (?) in Isaiah, which covers all Sundays until Proper 1, except for Christmas 2 and Epiphany 4. God's people are urged to 'walk in the light of the Lord', looking ahead to 'days to come' when the nations stream to God's house in Zion in order to walk in God's paths and find peace with each other. **Psalm 122** has people going up to 'the house of the Lord' and speaks of 'peace'.

## Advent 2

The Gospel readings all introduce John the Baptist.

Year A

* **Matthew 3.1-12** introduces John the Baptist baptizing with water for repentance and pointing towards one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. **Isaiah 11.1-10** continues in Isaiah, and speaks one who will come with the 'spirit of the Lord' and bring peace. **Psalm 72.1-7, 18-19** [or 72.1-7] speaks of the 'king' bringing 'justice' and 'peace'. **Romans 15.4-13** quotes Isaiah 11.10 and speaks of hope.

## Advent 3

The Gospel readings all continue with John the Baptist.

Year A

* **Matthew 11.2-11** has Jesus sending a message to John the Baptist about blind eyes being opened, and speaking about John the Baptist preparing the way. **Isaiah 35.1-10** continues in Isaiah, and is about God coming, reversing fortunes, strengthening the weak, opening the eyes of the blind, and a 'highway' being there. **Psalm 146.4-10** (EV: 5-10) says, 'the Lord opens the eyes of the blind'. Alternatively, the canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, which is about fortunes being reversed. **James 5.7-10** says, 'Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.'

## Advent 4

The Gospel readings all look towards Jesus' birth to Mary.

Year A

* **Matthew 1.18-25** leads up to the birth of Jesus to Mary, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about 'Emmanuel'. **Isaiah 7.10-16** continues in Isaiah, and looks ahead to a young woman bearing a son and calling him Immanuel. **Psalm 80.1-8, 18-20** (EV: 1-7, 17-19) [or 80.1-8 (EV: 1-7)] calls on God to 'come to our salvation' and 'show the light of your countenance', and speaks of 'the man at your right hand, the son of man you made so strong for yourself'. **Romans 1.1-7** says that Jesus 'was descended from David according to the flesh'.

# Christmas {#christmas}

## Christmas Day

Set I (emphasis on the salvation Jesus brings)

* **Isaiah 9.2-7** speaks of those in darkness seeing 'a great light', and announces that 'a child has been born', who will be named 'Wonderful Counsellor...', and who will reign 'with justice and with righteousness'.
* **Psalm 96** calls for rejoicing before the Lord, because 'he comes, he comes to judge the earth', 'with righteousness'.
* **Titus 2.11-14** says that 'the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all' through Jesus, who 'gave himself for us'.
* **Luke 2.1-14 [15-20]** is about Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, the angels appearing to the shepherds and announcing the birth of a Saviour, [and the shepherds going to Bethlehem to 'see'].

Set II (emphasis on God's glory appearing and being seen)

* **Isaiah 62.6-12** begins by speaking of king and nations who will 'see ... your glory', and says to Zion, 'See, your salvation comes'.
* **Psalm 97** says of the Lord that 'all the peoples have seen his glory'.
* **Titus 3.4-7** speaks of 'when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Saviour appeared'.
* **Luke 2.[1-7] 8-20** is about [Jesus' birth in Bethlehem], the angels appearing to the shepherds and announcing the birth of a Saviour, and the shepherds going to Bethlehem to 'see'.

Set III (emphasis on Jesus' divinity)

* **Isaiah 52.7-10** speaks of 'the return of the Lord to Zion', and says that he 'has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations'.
* **Psalm 98** speaks of the Lord bring victory by his 'own right hand and his holy arm', and calls for rejoicing before the Lord, because 'he comes to judge the earth'.
* **Hebrews 1.1-4 [5-12]** speaks of the 'Son' through whom God 'created the worlds', who is 'the exact imprint of God's very being', and who is 'superior to angels'. [When God 'brings the firstborn into the world', the angels worship him.]
* **John 1.1-14** speaks of the 'Word' who 'was God', through whom 'all things came into being', and who 'became flesh'.

## Christmas 1

Year A

* **Matthew 2.13-23** is part of the infancy narrative in Matthew, and describes Jesus being taken to Egypt to flee from Herod and then returning from Egypt. It therefore glimpses the suffering and exaltation of Jesus, which is reflected in the other readings. **Isaiah 63.7-9** continues in Isaiah, and says that the Lord 'became their saviour' and has 'lifted them up'.  **Psalm 148** [or 148.7-14] calls on the whole earth to praise the Lord, because he has 'raised up the horn of his people'. **Hebrews 2.10-18** is about God 'bringing many children to glory' through the incarnation and suffering of Jesus.

## Christmas 2*

These readings apply only when there is a Sunday between 2 and 5 January, and when Epiphany is not being celebrated on that day.

Years A, B and C

* **Jeremiah 31.7-14** has God showing grace to his people: 'I will comfort them'.
* Alternatively, **Ecclesiasticus 24.1-12** (from the Apocrypha) speaks of 'Wisdom', who 'came from the mouth of the Most High' (like the Word), and who was told by the Creator: 'Make your dwelling in Jacob' (like the Word becoming flesh).
* **Psalm 147.13-21** (EV: 12-20) praises God because he 'sends forth his command to the earth' and 'sends forth his word' (like the Word becoming flesh).
* Alternatively (as a canticle to follow the reading from Ecclesiasticus), **Wisdom of Solomon 10.15-21** (from the Apocrypha) is about wisdom.
* **Ephesians 1.3-14** praises God for 'his glorious grace' and speaks of God's plan 'to gather up all things in [Christ], things in heaven and things on earth' (as heaven and earth are brought together in the incarnation).
* **John 1.[1-9] 10-18** says that 'the Word became flesh', and that 'From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.'

# Epiphany {#epiphany}

Although the Sundays are the Sundays _of_ Epiphany, if Epiphany falls on a Sunday, the readings are moved to the following week. In other words, the readings for Epiphany N are used on the Nth Sunday _after_ Epiphany (as in the RCL).

Note that the RCL considers the 'Season of Epiphany' to be part of 'Ordinary Time', and to cover the whole period between Epiphany and Lent.

## The Epiphany

May be celebrated on the Sunday between 2 and 8 January.

Years A, B and C

* **Matthew 2.1-12** recounts the visit of 'wise men from the East' to the child Jesus in Bethlehem. **Isaiah 60.1-6** says that 'Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn', adding that 'They shall bring gold and frankincense'. **Psalm 72.[1-9] 10-15** speaks of kings bringing gifts (including gold) to 'the king'. **Ephesians 3.1-12** is about the Gentiles becoming 'fellow-heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel'.

## The Baptism of Christ: Epiphany 1

Celebrated on Monday 8 or 9 January if Epiphany is celebrated on Sunday 7 or 8 January.

Year A

* **Matthew 3.13-17** is Matthew's account of the baptism of Jesus, with 'the Spirit of God' descending on him, and 'a voice from heaven' saying, 'This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.' **Isaiah 42.1-9** continues in Isaiah, is echoed in the Gospel reading: 'Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights'. **Psalm 29** is about the 'voice of the Lord', including: 'The voice of the Lord is upon the waters'. **Acts 10.34-43** speaks of 'how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit' (as Peter shares the gospel with a Gentile, reflecting the Epiphany season).

## Epiphany 2

The Gospel readings for this Sunday are from John 1 and 2. In the RCL, it makes sense to see these readings as John's announcement of the beginning of Jesus' public ministry (with echoes of Jesus' baptism), to go alongside next week's readings from Matthew, Mark and Luke. This makes slightly less sense under Common Worship: see note on Epiphany 3.

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 1.1-9** begins a series covering almost all of 1 Corinthians 1-3. Paul gives thanks for the grace of God that has been given to the church in Corinth.
* **John 1.29-42** has John (the Baptist) saying of Jesus, 'Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world', reflecting the Epiphany season, adding that 'he was before me'. **Isaiah 49.1-7** continues in Isaiah, and has the 'servant' saying, 'The Lord called me before I was born', and the Lord saying to his servant, 'I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth'. **Psalm 40.1-12** (EV: 1-11) has the speaker saying, 'Lo, I come. In the scroll of the book it is written of me that I should do your will, O my God'.

## Epiphany 3

In the RCL, it makes sense to see this Sunday as marking the beginning of the semicontinuous series in the respective Gospel, with the Gospel reading marking the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. Common Worship has a different approach, which emphasises the Epiphany season, partly by including John 2.1-11 in Year A (Epiphany 4) and Year B (Epiphany 3), in addition to Year C (Epiphany 2), and partly by setting the Candlemas Gospel reading for Epiphany 4 in Year C.

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 1.10-18** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (without a gap), and is about divisions in the church.
* **Matthew 4.12-23** is the beginning of Jesus' ministry, in 'Galilee of the Gentiles'. (Matthew 4.18-22 is also set for Andrew.) **Isaiah 9.1-4** continues in Isaiah, and is quoted in the Gospel reading, including: 'The people ... in darkness have seen a great light'. **Psalm 27.1, 4-12** (EV: 1, 4-9) [or 27.1-11 (EV: 1-9a)] says, 'The Lord is my light and my salvation'.
  * Matthew 5.1-12: set for All Saints' Day (NB: RCL Epiphany 4).

Year B

RCL has Mark 1.14-20 as the Gospel reading, which is replaced by John 2.1-11.

Year C

* **Luke 4.14-21**
  * Luke 4.22-30: omitted (except 4.16-24 set for Bible Sunday) (NB: RCL Epiphany 4).
  * Luke 4.31-37: see Mark 1.21-28.
  * Luke 4.38-44: see Mark 1.29-39.

## Epiphany 4*

Displaced if Candlemas falls (or is celebrated) on a Sunday.

Year A

RCL has Matthew 5.1-12 as the Gospel reading, with related readings from Micah 6.1-8 and Psalm 15. Note that Matthew 5.1-12 is the Gospel reading for All Saints' Day. Micah 6.1-8, however, is not included elsewhere.

* **1 Corinthians 1.18-31** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (overlapping by one verse), and is about 'the message of the cross' and 'Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'. (Also set for Tuesday of Holy Week.)
* **John 2.1-11** is the account of Jesus turning water into wine, by which he 'revealed his glory' (an Epiphany theme). (This account features in Years A, B and C, each time on a different Sunday of Epiphany.) **1 Kings 17.8-16** is about Elijah's provision of meal and oil to a widow who was running out. **Psalm 36.5-10** is about God's provision: 'They shall be satisfied with the abundance of your house; they shall drink from the river of your delights. For with you is the well of life'.

Year C

RCL has Luke 4.21-30 as the Gospel reading, which is replaced by Luke 2.22-40 (the Gospel reading for Candlemas).

## The Presentation of Christ in the Temple (Candlemas)

May be celebrated on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February.

Years A, B and C

* **Luke 2.22-40** is the account of the child Jesus being presented in the temple, and concludes by saying that 'The child grew and became strong'. **Malachi 3.1-5** says that 'the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple', to 'purify'. **Psalm 24.[1-6] 7-10** calls for the 'gates' and 'doors' to be 'lifted up' so that the 'Lord', the 'King of glory', 'may come in' [and also speaks of the need for 'clean hands and pure hearts']. **Hebrews 2.14-18** speaks of Jesus sharing 'flesh and blood', and then doing the work of the (heavenly) temple, as 'a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people'.

# Ordinary Time {#ordinary-time-1}

* **Matthew 5.13-20** begins/resumes a semicontinuous series in Matthew 5-25, which covers these three Sundays in February, and all the Sundays between Trinity and Advent. Jesus speaks about being salt and light ('let your light shine before others'), about not coming to abolish the law or the prophets but to fulfil, and about righteousness. **Isaiah 58.1-9a [9b-12]** says 'your light shall break forth like the dawn' and 'rise in the darkness'. **Psalm 112.1-9 [10]** speaks of those whose righteousness is clearly seen.

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 3.10-11, 16-23** concludes the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (continuing without a gap), and is about building the church on the foundation of Jesus Christ. (The omitted verses about 'the Day' could easily be included: 'the fire will test what sort of work each has done'.)

(6.39-49 is the reading for the following week in the RCL, which is omitted in Common Worship: see discussion below. To fill in the gap, this week's reading could be extended to 6.42 'when opportunity allows'.) **Genesis 45.3-11, 15** is about Joseph's love for his brothers, who had behaved like his enemies. **Psalm 37.1-11, 40, 41** (EV: 1-11, 39, 40) [or 37.1-7] calls us not to fret about evildoers.

## 2 before Lent

Creation theme.

The addition of this creation-themed week means that 'Proper 3' in the RCL is not included (although the Gospel reading for Year A is almost the same). The Gospel readings from that week contain several famous sayings of Jesus:

* Mark 2.13-22 ('I have come to call not the righteous but sinners ... new wine into old wineskins'). The parallel passage in Luke 5.27-38 is also omitted, but the other parallel in Matthew 9.9-17 is partially included in Matthew 9.9-13, 18-26, and the gap could easily be filled.
* Luke 6.39-49...
  * 6.39 ('Can a blind person guide a blind person?'): see Matthew 15.14, which is included in Matthew 15.[10-20] 21-28.
  * 6.40 ('A disciple is not above the teacher'): see John 13.16, which is included on Maundy Thursday.
  * 6.41-42 ('speck ... log'): see Matthew 7.3-5, which is also omitted (last week's reading could be extended to this point).
  * 6.43-44 ('tree is known by its fruit'): see Matthew 7.16, 18, 20, which could be included by extending the reading from 7.21-29 to begin at verse 16.
  * 6.45 ('it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks'): see Matthew 12.34-35 (which is omitted) and a near parallel in Mark 7.20-23, which is (mostly) included in Mark 7.1-8, 14, 15, 21-23.
  * 6.46 ('Lord ... do what I say'): see Matthew 7.21, which is included in 7.21-29.
  * 6.47-49 ('house ... without a foundation'): see Matthew 7.24-27, which is included in 7.21-29.

Year A

* **Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.3** is about the creation of the heavens and the earth. **Psalm 136** or **Psalm 136.1-9, 23-26** is about God who 'made the heavens' (5-9) and 'gives food to all creatures' (25).
* **Romans 8.18-25** says that 'the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God'.
* **Matthew 6.25-34** says, 'do not worry', and invites us to consider God's care for the birds and the 'grass of the field'. (Also set for Harvest Thanksgiving, Year B.)
  * Matthew 7.1-2: see Luke 6.27-38.
  * Matthew 7.3-5: omitted, along with its parallel in Luke 6.41-42 (NB: RCL 'Proper 3').
  * Matthew 7.6: omitted.
  * Matthew 7.7-11: see Luke 11.1-13.
  * Matthew 7.12a: see Luke 6.27-38.
  * Matthew 7.12b: omitted.
  * Matthew 7.13-14: omitted, along with its close parallel in Luke 13.22-24.
  * Matthew 7.15-20: omitted.

## 1 before Lent

(RCL 'Last Sunday after the Epiphany', or 'Transfiguration Sunday'.)

Year A

* **Matthew 17.1-9** is Matthew's account of Jesus' Transfiguration, on a mountain, with Peter, James and John, with Moses and Elijah appearing, a cloud overshadowing them, and a voice saying, 'This is my Son'. **Exodus 24.12-18** is about Moses seeing the glory of the Lord on the mountain. **Psalm 2** has God saying, 'You are my Son'. Alternatively, **Psalm 99** (also set for Year C) says that God 'spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud', and calls people to 'worship him upon his holy hill'. **2 Peter 1.16-21** includes Peter's eyewitness account of the Transfiguration.

# Lent {#lent}

In terms of the Gospel readings for Lent 1-5, there is some structure to the readings, with all years building towards a climax in John 11 or 12. In Lent 1, the respective Gospel reading narrates Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. The readings from Lent 2-5 have the following themes:

* Year A looks at some encounters with Jesus in John's Gospel, related to baptism. (Lent originated as a period of preparation for baptism.) After John 3 in Lent 2, with its baptismal overtones, the remaining readings cover 'the three classic passages from John's Gospel used from the earliest times for the instruction of candidates for baptism: the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4), the healing of the man born blind (John 9), and the raising of Lazarus (John 11)'.[^Lent]
* Year B looks towards Jesus' death and resurrection (one week in Mark, followed by three weeks in John), and
* Year C, mostly in Luke, is less clearly structured, and is about Jesus setting out for Jerusalem (Lent 2), then about repentance (Lent 3) and Jesus welcoming sinners (Lent 4), before finishing in John with Jesus being anointed at Bethany.

## Ash Wednesday

Years A, B and C

* **Joel 2.1-2, 12-17** says, 'return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning'.
* Alternatively, **Isaiah 58.1-12** says, 'Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice ...'.
* **Psalm 51.1-18** (EV: 1-17) says, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God'.
* **2 Corinthians 5.20b &ndash; 6.10** says, 'we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God'.
* **Matthew 6.1-6, 16-21** is about 'your Father who sees in secret', in relation to almsgiving, prayer, fasting, and storing up treasures in heaven.
* Alternatively, **John 8.1-11** is about the woman caught in adultery: 'Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.'

## Lent 1

Year A

* **Psalm 32** is about confession and forgiveness of sin.
* **Matthew 4.1-11** is about Jesus being tempted by the devil in the wilderness. **Genesis 2.15-17; 3.1-7** is about Eve and Adam succumbing to the serpent's temptation in the garden. **Romans 5.12-19** compares Adam with Christ.

## Lent 2

The Old Testament reading each year is about God's promise to Abram. In the light of the fall (see last week), this could be intended as a reminder of God's gracious response to human sin.

Year A

* **Genesis 12.1-4a** is about God's call and promise to Abram, and the beginning of Abram's journey. **Psalm 121** gives assurance of God's protection on the journey. **Romans 4.1-5, 13-17** is about Abraham's faith in God's promise.
* **John 3.1-17** begins a series of baptism-related encounters with Jesus in John's Gospel, and is about Nicodemus's encounter with Jesus, with its discussion of being born 'of water and Spirit'.

## Lent 3

Year A

* **John 4.5-42** continues the baptism-related series in John, and is about the Samaritan woman's encounter with Jesus, including a discussion about 'living water' (i.e., the Spirit, 7.39), and about worshipping the Father 'in spirit and in truth'. **Exodus 17.1-7** is about Moses bringing water from the rock, in response to the people testing God at Massah and Meribah. **Psalm 95** recalls the time when the people tested God at Massah and Meribah. **Romans 5.1-11** says that 'God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit'.

## Lent 4

May be 'displaced' by Mothering Sunday.

Year A

* **John 9.1-41** continues the baptism-related series in John, and is about the blind man receiving sight by washing in water, after Jesus has said, 'I am the light of the world'. The Pharisees are 'blind' in that they cannot see who Jesus is. **1 Samuel 16.1-13** is about recognising the Lord's anointed (David). **Psalm 23** has a possible connection with the Old Testament reading ('you have anointed my head with oil'), but seems more likely to reflect the experience of the man born blind, who was led (to water) by Jesus. Note that John 9 leads directly into John 10, apparently inviting the conclusion that the man born blind is one of Jesus' sheep. **Ephesians 5.8-14** is about light and darkness.

## Mothering Sunday

The readings are related to mothering, but with a tinge of pain and hints of the cross, appropriately for Lent.

Years A, B and C

* **Exodus 2.1-10** is about Moses' mother placing her baby into the water, only to receive him back again from Pharaoh's daughter.
* Alternatively, **1 Samuel 1.20-28** is about Samuel's mother giving him to the Lord.
* **Psalm 34.11-20** says, 'Come, my children, and listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.'
* Alternatively, **Psalm 127.1-4** (EV: 1-3) says, 'Children are a heritage from the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his gift.'
* **2 Corinthians 1.3-7** is about suffering and consolation (reflecting the experience of motherhood, perhaps).
* Alternatively, **Colossians 3.12-17** is about virtues such as compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, patience and love (relevant for motherhood, perhaps).
* **Luke 2.33-35** has Simeon saying to Mary, 'a sword will pierce your own soul too'.
* Alternatively, **John 19.25-27** has Jesus speaking to his mother from the cross.

## Lent 5

Year A

* **John 11.1-45** concludes the baptism-related series in John, and is about the dying and rising of Lazarus, which is related to baptism, and also looks ahead to Jesus' death and resurrection. **Ezekiel 37.1-14** is about God's breath (spirit) bringing dry bones to life. **Psalm 130** is about waiting for redemption: 'Out of the depths have I cried to you, O Lord'. **Romans 8.6-11** is about God giving life to mortal bodies through his Spirit.

## Palm Sunday

The lectionary assumes a 'Liturgy of the Palms' and a 'Liturgy of the Passion', each with its own reading from the Gospels and the Psalms (as in [_Times and Seasons_](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/times-and-seasons-2#mmm151)). But this is not mandatory, and it is not clear what should be done if there is no 'Liturgy of the Palms'. Presumably that part could simply be omitted. But the [RCL](http://www.commontexts.org/rcl/download/) describes an alternative: 'Those who do not observe the procession with palms and do not wish to use the passion gospel may substitute the gospel and psalm given for the Liturgy of the Passion with the gospel and psalm indicated for the Liturgy of the Palms. Whenever possible, the whole passion narrative should be read.'

**Liturgy of the Palms**

Year A

* **Matthew 21.1-11** is Matthew's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (branches are mentioned, but no palms specifically).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-29** [or 118.19-24] is about entering (the city) with joy, and says, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord', which is echoed in all four Gospel accounts ('hosanna' comes from 'save' in the previous verse).

Year B

* **Mark 11.1-11** is Mark's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (branches are mentioned, but no palms specifically).
* Alternatively, **John 12.12-16**  is John's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (and the only account to mention palm branches).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-24** [or 118.19-24] omits the verse about 'Blessed is he...' (see Year A), presumably for brevity, and therefore focuses on entering (the city) with joy.

Year C

* **Luke 19.28-40** is Luke's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (no palms or branches are mentioned).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-29** [or 118.19-24]: see Year A.

**Liturgy of the Passion**

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the Gospel reading.

## Maundy Thursday

Years A, B and C

* **Exodus 12.1-4 [5-10], 11-14** is the institution of the Passover.
* **Psalm 116.1, 10-17** (EV: 1-2, 12-19) [or 116.9-17 (EV: 116.10-19)] says, 'I will lift up the cup of salvation'.
* **1 Corinthians 11.23-26** is the institution of the Lord's Supper.

# Easter {#easter}

A reading from Acts is included at every service between Easter Day and Pentecost, and it 'must be used as either the first or second reading'.

Gospel readings between Easter Day and Pentecost are exclusively from John's Gospel (continuing to Trinity Sunday in Years B and C), except on Easter 3 in Years A and B, on Ascension Day, and except for the alternative readings for Easter Day (which duplicate those for the Easter Vigil). Furthermore, on Easter 5, 6 and 7 (and on Pentecost in Years B and C, and Trinity in Year C), the readings are from the 'farewell discourse' (John 13-17).

## Easter Vigil

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the Gospel reading. 'A minimum of three Old Testament readings should be chosen. The reading from Exodus 14 should always be used.'

* **Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.4a** picks up on Easter and baptismal themes of (new) creation out of water, new life, and light out of darkness. **Psalm 136.1-9, 23-26** praises God as Creator.
* **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 4, spread over three weeks in Year A, Easter 4-6), picks up on the resurrection of Jesus being like passing through the waters of the flood. The dove points towards the gift of the Spirit at Pentecost. **Psalm 46** is about God as a refuge, 'Though the waters rage and swell'.
* **Genesis 22.1-18** (also the alternative _alternative_ first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) is about Abraham's beloved son Isaac being taken to the point of death and rescued. **Psalm 16** says, 'Preserve me, O God,' and 'you will not abandon my soul to Death'.
* **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 2) draws on the connection between Israel passing through the Red Sea and Jesus passing through death to new life. The canticle **Exodus 15.1b-13, 17, 18** continues the theme.
* **Isaiah 55.1-11** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year B) picks up on baptismal themes: 'come to the waters', and 'as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth ...'. The canticle **Isaiah 12.2-6** says, 'With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.'
* **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 &ndash; 4.4** (from the Apocrypha, also the alternative first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) is about wisdom, perhaps picking up on the Easter theme of newness of life. (Alternatively, **Proverbs 8.1-8, 19-21; 9.4b-6** is also about wisdom.) **Psalm 19** says, 'the testimony of the Lord ... gives wisdom to the simple'.
* **Ezekiel 36.24-28** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 7) says to a people in exile, 'I will sprinkle clean water upon you,' and 'I will put my spirit within you'. **Psalms 42, 43** expresses longing for God.
* **Ezekiel 37.1-14** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year C, and Pentecost, Year B, and the Old Testament reading for Lent 5, Year A) is about God's breath (spirit) bringing dry bones to life. **Psalm 143** speaks about being made to 'sit in darkness like those long dead', and says, 'Revive me, O Lord'.
* **Zephaniah 3.14-20** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 3) rejoices in God's salvation, and in fortunes being restored. **Psalm 98** rejoices in God's salvation.
* **Romans 6.3-11** connects baptism with the death and resurrection of Jesus. **Psalm 114** connects this with Israel coming out of Egypt and crossing the Jordan.

Year A

* **Matthew 28.1-10** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Matthew's account of the discovery of the empty tomb, and the appearance of the risen Jesus to the women.

Year B

* **Mark 16.1-8** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Mark's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

Year C

* **Luke 24.1-12** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Luke's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

## Easter Day

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the alternative first reading, the epistle, and the alternative Gospel reading.

  * Luke 12.31: see Matthew 6.25-34.

## Sunday between 7 and 13 August (Proper 14)

Year C

* **Isaiah 1.1, 10-20** continues the series on the prophets, and is the first of two weeks in Isaiah (moving on chronologically from Hosea). Both readings are quite hard-hitting, which provides a smooth transition into Jeremiah. (Isaiah's call featured in Proper 1.) God has no pleasure in his people's offerings when their hands are 'full of blood'. **Psalm 50.1-8, 23, 24** (EV: 1-8, 22, 23) [or 50.1-7]  speaks of God testifying against his people, despite their sacrifices.
* **Hebrews 11.1-3, 8-16** begins a series in Hebrews 11-13, and is about the faith of Abraham.
* **Luke 12.32-40** continues the series in Luke, and is about treasure in heaven and the coming of the Son of Man. The choice of verses seems odd, but it captures the seamless transition between 'don't worry' (22-34) and 'be ready' (35-48). (The reading could be extended to verse 48, 'when opportunity allows'.) The 'Related' reading, **Genesis 15.1-6**, is about Abram looking to his reward and trusting God's promise. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 33.12-22** [or 33.12-21] is about waiting for God, who is our 'shield' (Genesis 15.1).
  * Luke 12.41: omitted.
  * Luke 12.42-46: omitted, along with its parallel in Matthew 24.45-51.
  * Luke 12.47-48: omitted.

## Sunday between 14 and 20 August (Proper 15)

Year C

* **Isaiah 5.1-7** continues the series on the prophets, and is the second of two weeks in Isaiah. God's vineyard, Israel, has 'yielded wild grapes'. **Psalm 80.1-2, 9-20** (EV: 1-2a, 8-19) [or 80.9-20 (EV: 8-19)] is about God's 'vine'.
* **Hebrews 11.29 &ndash; 12.2** continues the series in Hebrews 11-13, and is about faith and perseverance.
* **Luke 12.49-56** continues the series in Luke, and is about Jesus coming to bring 'fire to the earth', not bringing peace but division. The 'Related' reading, **Jeremiah 23.23-29**, speaks of God's word being like fire, and is about the God who fills heaven and earth coming in judgment. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 82**, calls on God to 'judge the earth'.
  * Luke 12.57-59: see Matthew 5.21-37.
  * Luke 13.1-9: set for Lent 3.

## Sunday between 21 and 27 August (Proper 16)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 1.4-10** continues the series on the prophets, and begins an 8-week vaguely-sequential series in Jeremiah (moving on chronologically from Isaiah), along with one week in Lamentations. The series moves from warning to judgment to hope. This week, Jeremiah the prophet is commissioned, having been set apart before he was born. **Psalm 71.1-6** is about trusting in God from birth onwards.
* **Hebrews 12.18-29** continues the series in Hebrews 11-13, contrasting Sinai with Mount Zion.
* **Luke 13.10-17** continues the series in Luke, and is about the crippled woman being healed on the sabbath, so that she 'stood up straight and began praising God'. The 'Related' reading, **Isaiah 58.9b-14**, is about honouring the sabbath and delighting in God, who will 'satisfy your needs'. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 103.1-8**, speaks of God as the one who 'satisfies you with good things'.
  * Luke 13.18-19: see Mark 4.26-34.
  * Luke 13.18-21: see Matthew 13.31-33, 44-52.
  * Luke 13.22-24: omitted, along with its close parallel in Matthew 7.13-14.
  * Luke 13.25-27: see Matthew 7.21-29.
  * Luke 13.28-29: omitted, along with its parallel in Matthew 8.11-12.
  * Luke 13.30: see Matthew 20.1-16 and Mark 10.17-31.
  * Luke 13.31-35: set for Lent 2.

## Sunday between 28 August and 3 September (Proper 17)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 2.4-13** continues the series on the prophets and in Jeremiah, and is about God's people forsaking him in favour of 'cracked cisterns'. **Psalm 81.1, 10-16** [or 81.1-11] is about God's desire to 'fill' and 'satisfy' his people, but their refusal to listen.
* **Hebrews 13.1-8, 15, 16** concludes the series in Hebrews 11-13, and is about the 'sacrifices' that are 'pleasing to God'.
* **Luke 14.1, 7-14** continues the series in Luke, and is about taking the place of honour at a feast. (These verses are selected from verses 1-24, which form a single unit. The reading could be extended 'when opportunity allows'.) The 'Related' reading from the Apocrypha, **Ecclesiasticus 10.12-18**, is about pride and humility. The alternative 'Related' reading, **Proverbs 25.6-7**, says it is better to take the humble place and be exalted than vice versa. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 112**, says that those who give freely to the poor will be exalted.
  * Luke 14.15-24: omitted, but see similar passage in Matthew 22.1-14.

## Sunday between 4 and 10 September (Proper 18)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 18.1-11** continues the series on the prophets and in Jeremiah (out of sequence, perhaps to maintain a thematic sequence from warning to judgment, and perhaps chosen to fit with the Gospel reading and its themes of choice and consequences). God is the potter, and is calling his people to change their ways. **Psalm 139.1-5, 12-18** (EV: 1-6, 13-18) [or 139.1-7 (EV: 1-8)] is about the God who formed us (as a potter).
* **Philemon 1-21** is Paul's appeal for runaway slave Onesimus. Perhaps it appears here because it mentions Timothy (see next week).
* **Luke 14.25-33** continues the series in Luke, and is about the cost of being a disciple. (14.34-35 could be included for completeness 'when opportunity allows'.) The 'Related' reading, **Deuteronomy 30.15-20** calls its hearers to consider the benefits that follow when they 'choose life', and the curses that follow when they do not. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 1**, is about the blessings that await the righteous, and the judgment that awaits the wicked.
  * Luke 14.34-35: see the similar saying in Matthew 5.13-20 and Mark 9.38-50.

## Sunday between 11 and 17 September (Proper 19)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 4.11-12, 22-28** continues the series on the prophets and in Jeremiah, and is about the land becoming a desolation as a consequence of the people's foolishness. **Psalm 14** is about the foolishness of turning from God.
* **1 Timothy 1.12-17** begins a three-week series in 1 Timothy. Paul, the foremost of sinners, received mercy.
* **Luke 15.1-10** continues the series in Luke, and is about God welcoming sinners, and the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin. (These parables go together with that of the lost son, which follows directly, and which is set for Lent 4, but which might have been 'displaced' by Mothering Sunday.) The 'Related' reading, **Exodus 32.7-14**, is about God forgiving sinners, after the incident with the golden calf. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 51.1-11** (EV: 1-10), is about the forgiveness of sins.
  * Luke 15.11-32: set for Lent 4 (NB: Mothering Sunday).

## Sunday between 18 and 24 September (Proper 20)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 8.18 &ndash; 9.1** continues the series on the prophets and in Jeremiah, and expresses sorrow for the pain of 'my poor people'. **Psalm 79.1-9** cries out to God over the desolation of Jerusalem.
* **1 Timothy 2.1-7** continues the series in 1 Timothy, with a call to pray for everyone.
* **Luke 16.1-13** continues the series in Luke, with the parable of the shrewd and dishonest manager. The 'Related' reading, **Amos 8.4-7**, speaks against those who 'trample on the needy' and 'practise deceit'. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 113**, speaks of God who 'lifts the needy from the ashes'.
  * Luke 16.14-16: omitted.
  * Luke 16:17: see Matthew 5.13-20.
  * Luke 16:18: see Matthew 5.21-37 and Mark 10.2-16.

## Sunday between 25 September and 1 October (Proper 21)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 32.1-3a, 6-15** continues the series on the prophets and in Jeremiah, and begins to glimpse hope for the distant future, with the purchase of a field. **Psalm 91.1-6, 14-16** [or 91.11-16] promises deliverance for those who take refuge in God.
* **1 Timothy 6.6-19** concludes the series in 1 Timothy, with a call to 'Fight the good fight of the faith', and with teaching about riches (which &ndash; coincidentally? &ndash; fits well with the Gospel reading).
* **Luke 16.19-31** continues the series in Luke, with the rich man and Lazarus. The 'Related' reading, **Amos 6.1a, 4-7**, is a warning for the rich. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 146**, warns that princes will perish, but promises 'bread to those who hunger'.
  * Luke 17.1-2: omitted, along with its parallel in Matthew 18.6-7.
  * Luke 17.3-4: see Matthew 18.15-20 and 18.21-35.

## Sunday between 2 and 8 October (Proper 22)

Year C

* **Lamentations 1.1-6** continues the series on the prophets, and provides a brief excursion from Jeremiah. It laments the desolation of Jerusalem, but the canticle, **Lamentations 3.19-26** glimpses hope for the future. As an alternative to the canticle, **Psalm 137** [or 137.1-6], is about the desolation of Jerusalem.
* **2 Timothy 1.1-14** begins a four-week series in 2 Timothy, with a call to remain faithful to the gospel.
* **Luke 17.5-10** continues the series in Luke, with teaching about faith and duty. The 'Related' reading, **Habakkuk 1.1-4; 2.1-4**, features the prophet's faith being increased (perhaps). The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 37.1-9**, is a response to Habakkuk's cries about wrongdoers, and calls for faith in God.

## Sunday between 9 and 15 October (Proper 23)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 29.1, 4-7** continues the series on the prophets and in Jeremiah, and is a word of comfort and assurance for God's people in exile (out of sequence, presumably for thematic reasons). (Extending the reading by a few verses would provide additional comfort.) **Psalm 66.1-11** (EV: 1-12) is about being brought 'through fire and water ... into a place of liberty'.
* **2 Timothy 2.8-15** continues the series in 2 Timothy, with a call to endurance.
* **Luke 17.11-19** continues the series in Luke (without a gap), with the cleansing of the ten lepers, only one of whom (a Samaritan) gave praise to God. (See also Harvest Thanksgiving.) The 'Related' reading, **2 Kings 5.1-3, 7-15c**, is about Naaman being cured of leprosy. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 111**, is a psalm of thanksgiving for God's powerful works.
  * Luke 17.20-22: omitted
  * Luke 17.23: omitted, along with its parallel in Matthew 24.23. Compare Luke 21.5-19.
  * Luke 17.24: omitted, along with its parallel in Matthew 24.27.
  * Luke 17.25: various parallels.
  * Luke 17.26-27: see Matthew 24.36-44.
  * Luke 17.28-30: omitted.
  * Luke 17.31: omitted, along with its parallel in Matthew 24.17-18.
  * Luke 17.32: omitted.
  * Luke 17.33: various parallels.
  * Luke 17.34-35[36]: see Matthew 24.36-44.
  * Luke 17.37: omitted, along with its parallel in Matthew 24.28.

## Sunday between 16 and 22 October (Proper 24)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 31.27-34** continues the series on the prophets and concludes the series in Jeremiah, with the promise of a new covenant: 'I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts'. **Psalm 119.97-104** begins, 'Lord, how I love your law!'
* **2 Timothy 3.14 &ndash; 4.5** continues the series in 2 Timothy, with a call to faithful proclamation.
* **Luke 18.1-8** continues the series in Luke, with the parable of the persistent widow. The 'Related' reading, **Genesis 32.22-31**, is about Jacob's persistence with God. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 121**, is about looking to the Lord for help.

## Sunday between 23 and 29 October (Proper 25)

Omitted if Bible Sunday is observed.

Year C

* **Joel 2.23-32** concludes the series on the prophets, with a single extract from Joel. Joel is difficult to date, so it is unlikely that this passage is here for chronological reasons. It follows well from last week, with the promise that God will pour abundant rain on the earth, and his spirit on all flesh. **Psalm 65** [or 65.1-7 (EV: 1-8)] is about God watering the earth abundantly.
* **2 Timothy 4.6-8, 16-18** concludes the series in 2 Timothy, with Paul looking towards his departure.
* **Luke 18.9-14** continues the series in Luke (without a gap), with the parable of the Pharisee and the tax-collector. The 'Related' reading, **Ecclesiasticus 35.12-17**, is about God listening to the prayer of the poor (the tax-collector being taken as someone who is poor, at least in spirit, presumably). The alternative 'Related' reading, **Jeremiah 14.7-10, 19-22**, is a confession of sin and a plea for God's help. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 84.1-7** (EV: 1-8), expresses a desire 'to enter the courts of the Lord', and asks God to 'hear my prayer'.
  * Luke 18.15-17: see Mark 10.2-16.
  * Luke 18.18-30: see Mark 10.17-31.
  * Luke 18.31-34: see Mark 9.30-32 for a close parallel.
  * Luke 18.35-43: see Mark 10.46-52.

## The Last Sunday after Trinity if observed as Bible Sunday

Year C

* **Isaiah 45.22-25** has God saying, 'from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall not return'.

* **Romans 15.1-6** speaks of the scriptures, that 'whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction'.
* **Luke 4.16-24** tells of Jesus reading from Isaiah and saying, 'Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.' (Luke 4.14-21 is also set for Epiphany 3.)

# Festivals {#festivals}

According to the [Rules], Festivals are 'not usually displaced'. However,

> Festivals falling on a Sunday are to be kept on that day or transferred to the Monday (or, at the discretion of the minister, to the next suitable weekday). But a Festival may not be celebrated on Sundays in Advent, Lent or Eastertide. Festivals coinciding with a Principal Feast or Principal Holy Day are transferred to the first available day.

One of these Festivals might be the Patronal or Dedication Festival, which can be observed either as a Festival or as a Principal Feast. According to the [Rules],

> When kept as Principal Feasts, the Patronal and Dedication Festivals may be transferred to the nearest Sunday, unless that day is already a Principal Feast or one of the following days: the First Sunday of Advent, the Baptism of Christ, the First Sunday of Lent, the Fifth Sunday of Lent or Palm Sunday.

If it falls on one of those days, it must be transferred.

## The Naming and Circumcision of Jesus (1 January)

If Jesus was born on 25 December, he was circumcised on 1 January.

* **Numbers 6.22-27** connects the Aaronic blessing with the Lord's name: 'So they shall put my name on the Israelites'.
* **Psalm 8** says to the Lord, 'how glorious is your name'.
* **Galatians 4.4-7** says that Jesus was 'born under the law', which explains why he was circumcised.
* **Luke 2.15-21** says, 'After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.'

## The Conversion of Paul (25 January)

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Conversion of Paul ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **Jeremiah 1.4-10** is about Jeremiah's call as 'a prophet to the nations'. (See below for the alternative, **Acts 9.1-22**.)
* **Psalm 67** says, 'let all the peoples praise you'.
* **Acts 9.1-22** is the account of Saul/Paul's experience on the road to Damascus, in which the Lord says of him, 'he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles'.
* Alternatively, the passage from Acts can be the first reading, with **Galatians 1.11-16a** as the second reading, in which Paul says that God 'was pleased to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles'.
* **Matthew 19.27-30** is Jesus' promise to those who have 'left everything and followed [him]', which is the essence of conversion.

## Joseph of Nazareth (19 March)

19 March always falls during Lent. According to the [Rules],

> When St Joseph’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter or, if the Annunciation has already been moved to that date, to the first available day thereafter.

* **2 Samuel 7.4-16** is God's message to David, saying of David's son, 'I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.'
* **Psalm 89.26-36** has God saying of David, 'He shall call to me, "You are my Father,"' and 'His seed shall endure for ever'.
* **Romans 4.13-18** moves (apparently) from the idea of Jesus being treated as Joseph's son, to the idea of believers being treated as descendants of Abraham.
* **Matthew 1.18-25** is about Joseph, who 'took [Mary] as his wife', and 'named [her son] Jesus'.

## The Annunciation of Our Lord to the Blessed Virgin Mary (25 March)

This is a Principal Feast, but it comes across as somewhat unwanted, as it is never celebrated on a Sunday. 25 March always fall during Lent, or very occasionally on or just after Easter Day. According to the [Rules],

> the Annunciation, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to the Monday following or, falling between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.

* **Isaiah 7.10-14** says, 'Look, the young woman [Gk _the virgin_] is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.'
* **Psalm 40.5-11** (EV: 5-10) reflects Mary's response: 'In the scroll of the book it is written of me that I should do your will, O my God; I delight to do it: your law is within my heart.'
* **Hebrews 10.4-10** quotes Psalm 40 in relation to Jesus: 'Then I said, "See, God, I have come to do your will, O God" (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).'
* **Luke 1.26-38** is about the visit of Gabriel to Mary: 'you will conceive in your womb and bear a son', concluding with Mary saying, 'Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.'

## George, Martyr, Patron of England (23 April)

23 April always falls during or just before Easter season (Easter always falls between 22 March and 25 April), so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast). According to the [Rules],

> When St George’s Day or St Mark’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter. If both fall in this period, St George’s Day is transferred to the Monday and St Mark’s Day to the Tuesday.

## Mark the Evangelist (25 April)

25 April always falls during Easter season, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast). See above on George (23 April).

## Philip and James, Apostles (1 May)

1 May always falls during Easter season, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

## Matthias the Apostle (14 May)

14 May always falls between Easter and Trinity, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of Matthias ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

## The Visit of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Elizabeth (31 May)

31 May usually falls between Easter and Trinity, so this Festival can rarely be celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

## Barnabas the Apostle (11 June)

11 June occasionally falls before Trinity (20 June at the latest).

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... Barnabas ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

## The Birth of John the Baptist (24 June)

## Peter and Paul, Apostles (29 June)

## Thomas the Apostle (3 July)

## Mary Magdalene (22 July)

## James the Apostle (25 July)

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... James ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

## The Transfiguration of Our Lord (6 August)

## The Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August)

## Bartholomew the Apostle (24 August)

## Holy Cross Day (14 September)

This is also known as the Feast of the 'Exaltation of the Cross', and has its origins in more than one event associated with the cross and Jerusalem. The theme of exaltation is reflected in the readings.

* **Psalm 22.23-28** expresses praise to the Lord, who 'has not despised nor abhorred the suffering of the poor', which fits with the theme of the crucified one being exalted.
* **Philippians 2.6-11** is about Christ humbling himself to 'death on a cross' and subsequently being exalted.
* **John 3.13-17** is about the Son of Man being 'lifted up', 'just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness'. **Numbers 21.4-9** is about the bronze serpent.

## Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist (21 September)

Matthew was a tax-collector. This is reflected in the readings.

* **Proverbs 3.13-18** says that wisdom is better than silver and gold.
* **Psalm 119.65-72** says that God's law is 'dearer to me than a hoard of gold and silver'.
* **2 Corinthians 4.1-6** has several possible connections with Matthew: renouncing 'shameful things', the 'open statement of the truth' (in writing his Gospel), light shining into Matthew's heart.
* **Matthew 9.9-13** tells of Jesus calling Matthew the tax-collector to follow him, and of Jesus eating with 'tax-collectors and sinners'.

## Michael and All Angels (29 September)

Michael the archangel is mentioned four times in Scripture: Daniel 10.13-21 and 12.1, Jude 9 and Revelation 12.7.

* **Genesis 28.10-17** is Jacob's dream of a 'ladder' with 'the angels of God ... ascending and descending on it', which is echoed in the Gospel reading.
* (See below for the alternative, **Revelation 12.7-12**.)
* **Psalm 103.19-22** says, 'Bless the Lord, you angels of his'.
* **Revelation 12.7-12** is about 'Michael and his angels' fighting against 'the dragon ... and his angels'.
* Alternatively, the passage from Revelation can be the first reading, with **Hebrews 1.5-14** as the second reading, contrasting angels with the Son: see 1.1-4 and 2.1-4.)
* **John 1.47-51** has Jesus saying to Nathanael, 'you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man', echoing the Old Testament reading.

## Luke the Evangelist (18 October)

Luke was a 'physician' (Colossians 4.14). This is reflected in the readings. (Elsewhere, Luke is mentioned by name only in 2 Timothy 4.11 and Philemon 24.)

* **Isaiah 35.3-6** is about the restoration of health.
* Alternatively, **Acts 16.6-12a** contains the first 'we' of the narrative, subtly indicating the point at which Luke joined Paul and his companions.
* **Psalm 147.1-7** says that the Lord 'heals the brokenhearted and binds up all their wounds'.
* **2 Timothy 4.5-17** says, 'Only Luke is with me.'
* **Luke 10.1-9** is about the mission of the seventy, which perhaps speaks more directly to those (such as Luke) who are not numbered among the Twelve. They were sent out to 'cure the sick' and to speak of the 'kingdom of God', which is appropriate to Luke as a physician and the author of one of the Gospels.

## Simon and Jude, Apostles (28 October)

Simon, one of the Twelve (not Peter), appears as 'the Cananaean' in Matthew 10.4 and Mark 3.18, and as 'the Zealot' in Luke 6.15 and Acts 1.13.

Jude, one of the Twelve, is mentioned as 'Judas son of James' in Luke 6.16 and Acts 1.13, as 'Judas (not Iscariot)' when he asks a question in John 14.22, and (presumably) as 'Thaddaeus' (or 'Lebbaeus') in Matthew 10.3 and as 'Thaddaeus' in Mark 3.18. The Greek behind 'son of James' is simply 'of James', which has historically led many (especially in the West) to identify this Jude with the author of the Epistle of Jude (who describes himself as 'Jude ... brother of James'), who is identified with 'Judas', a brother of Jesus, mentioned in Matthew 13.55 and Mark 6.3.

According to tradition, Simon and Jude worked together as evangelists and were martyred together.

* **Ephesians 2.19-22** speaks of the church as being 'built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone'. **Isaiah 28.14-16** has God speaking of 'a foundation stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation'. **Psalm 119.89-96** reflects the theme of foundations: the Lord's word 'stands firm', the Lord has 'established the earth', and the Lord's 'judgements stand firm'.
* **John 15.17-27** reflects Simon and Jude's calling, by speaking of persecution and of Jesus' command to his disciples to 'testify'.

## Andrew the Apostle (30 November)

30 November, if it is a Sunday, falls on the First Sunday of Advent, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (not even if it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

'In the Anglican Communion, St Andrewstide is widely observed by intercessions for foreign missions.'[^Andrew] This is the emphasis in the readings.

* **Romans 10.12-18** is about the good news being proclaimed 'to all the earth', echoing Jesus' call to Andrew. The other two readings are quoted: **Isaiah 52.7-10** ('How beautiful ... are the feet') and **Psalm 19.1-6** ('... their words to the ends of the world').
* **Matthew 4.18-22** has Jesus calling two pairs of brothers as his first followers: Simon Peter and Andrew, followed by James and John. To the first pair, Jesus says, 'Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.'

## Stephen, Deacon, First Martyr (26 December)

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... Stephen, the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **2 Chronicles 24.20-22** is about the stoning of Zechariah (who said as he was dying, 'May the Lord see and avenge!').
* (See below for the alternative, **Acts 7.51-60**.)
* **Psalm 119.161-168** speaks of being 'persecuted ... without a cause'.
* **Acts 7.51-60** is about the stoning of Stephen (who said as he was dying, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them').
* Alternatively, the passage from Acts can be the first reading, with **Galatians 2.16b-20** as the second reading, which speaks of having been 'crucified with Christ'.
* **Matthew 10.17-22** warns of being 'put to death' because of Jesus.

## John, Apostle and Evangelist (27 December)

John the Apostle (son of Zebedee) is traditionally identified with the evangelist who wrote 'John's Gospel', with the author of the 'Letters of John', and with the author of the Book of Revelation.

* **Psalm 117** may have been chosen because John's testimony was for all nations.
* **1 John 1** is about John's eyewitness testimony.
* **John 21.19b-25** says that 'the disciple whom Jesus loved', 'the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper', was the one who wrote this Gospel. **Exodus 33.7-11a** speaks of a similarly close relationship: 'the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend'.

## The Holy Innocents (28 December)

The infants of Bethlehem are often celebrated as martyrs, and this may be reflected in the readings.

* **Psalm 124** speaks of having 'escaped', as the infant Jesus (and the other infants?) escaped from Herod.
* **1 Corinthians 1.26-29** speaks of God choosing 'what is weak in the world to shame the strong', inviting a contrast between the infant Jesus (and the other infants?) and Herod.
* **Matthew 2.13-18** says that Herod 'killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under'. **Jeremiah 31.15-17** is quoted: 'Rachel weeping for her children'.
