title: Commentary on the Common Worship Principal Service Lectionary

This is a commentary on the _lectionary_, not a commentary on the _passages_. The aim is to answer the question: _Why was this passage chosen?_

Note that there is often no 'theme' tying the readings together. (Many people persist in looking for one, even decades after the ASB.) Where readings are closely related, they are grouped together below. In many cases, however, a particular reading will not be related to other readings on the same day, but it will turn out to be part of a series on a particular book of the Bible running over several weeks. The principle of continuous (or semicontinuous) reading of Scripture is one of the key principles behind the lectionary.

**Common Worship** was introduced in the Church of England in 2000. It includes a [Lectionary for Sundays, Principal Feasts and Holy Days, and Festivals](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary). This page covers the **Principal Service Lectionary**, which is drawn (with modifications) from the ecumenical **Revised Common Lectionary (RCL)**.

**_Work in progress!_**

* Year A: hardly begun
* Year B: hardly begun
* Year C: complete from Easter Day to Trinity
* Festivals: what festivals?!

## The Bible and the lectionary

For the Gospels, Year A focuses on Matthew, Year B on Mark, and Year C on Luke. John is read in Years A, B and C, mostly during the seasons (especially Easter), but with some appearances in Ordinary Time in Year B (such as a summer series on John 6). During the Sundays in Ordinary Time (excluding the two before Lent), the readings in Matthew, Mark and Luke are sequential (semicontinuous), with just one exception (Year B, 3 before Advent, Mark 1.14-20). This covers the bulk of each gospel (Matthew 5-25, Mark 1-13 and Luke 5-21, plus a bit of 23). Material from Matthew 1-4, Mark 1 and Luke 1-4 is included in Advent, Christmas, Epiphany and Lent (along with extracts from other chapters), and the resurrection accounts are included during Easter. Note that the passion narratives (Matthew 26-27, Mark 14-15 and Luke 22-23), with one or two small exceptions, are included _only_ on Palm Sunday, within the Liturgy of the Passion.

Acts is read only at the Baptism of Christ and in every Principal Service between Easter Day and Pentecost (and on some festivals).

Old Testament 'Continuous' readings after Trinity, cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A: Genesis, Exodus and Deuteronomy 34
* Year B: 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings (up to chapter 8), and selections from Song of Solomon, Proverbs, Esther and Job
* Year C: 1 Kings (from chapter 17), 2 Kings (up to chapter 5), Amos, Hosea, Isaiah (briefly!), Jeremiah, Lamentations, Joel

New Testament readings after Trinity and before Advent cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A: Romans, Philippians and 1 Thessalonians
* Year B: 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, James and Hebrews 1-10
* Year C: Galatians, Colossians, Hebrews 11-13, Philemon, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and 2 Thessalonians

What about the rest of the Bible (apart from the Gospels and the Psalms)? As well as cameo appearances during seasons and festivals, and 'Related' Old Testament readings after Trinity, the Bible is read systematically as follows:

* Old Testament
  * Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy and Joshua: no systematic readings
  * Judges, Ruth: not included
  * 1 and 2 Chronicles: not included (outside festivals)
  * Ezra: not included
  * Nehemiah: no systematic readings
  * Ecclesiastes: once as a 'Related' reading
  * Isaiah: features prominently in Advent, Christmas and Epiphany, and at other times (not sequential)
  * Ezekiel, Daniel: no systematic readings
  * Obadiah: not included
  * Jonah, Micah: no systematic readings
  * Nahum: not included
  * Habakkuk: once as a 'Related' reading
  * Zephaniah: no systematic readings
  * Haggai: not included
  * Zechariah: once as a 'Related' reading
  * Malachi: no systemic readings
* New Testament
  * Acts: Easter season, Years A, B and C (vaguely sequential)
  * 1 Corinthians:
    * Year A: chapters 1-3 after Epiphany and in February
    * Year B: chapter 9 for two Sundays in February
    * Year C: chapters 12-13 for two Sundays in Epiphany, preceded by chapter 15 for three Sundays in February
  * Titus: no systematic readings
  * 1 Peter: Easter season, Year A
  * 2 Peter: no systematic readings
  * 1 John: Easter season, Year B
  * 2 John, 3 John, Jude: not included
  * Revelation: Easter season, Year C (also three Sundays in Epiphany, Year B, not sequential)

## Choosing between the readings

Each service has the following readings:

* **Old Testament reading** (or sometimes a reading from Acts),
* **psalm or canticle** (usually a response to the first reading),
* **New Testament reading** (from an epistle or Revelation), and
* **Gospel reading**.

The psalm or canticle should normally be used, along with two or three of the other readings. When using just two of the other readings, Common Worship specifies:

> When there are only two readings at the principal service and that service is Holy Communion, the second reading is always the Gospel reading. ...
>
> When the Principal Service Lectionary is used at a service other than Holy Communion, the Gospel reading need not always be chosen.

In addition, when the first reading is from Acts, it must be included as one of the readings.

Note that in Common Worship Holy Communion (Order One or Two), 'Either one or two readings from Scripture precede the Gospel reading', and 'The psalm or canticle follows the first reading'. As the psalm or canticle is usually related to the Old Testament reading, this makes a lot of sense when that reading is used; it makes less sense when the Old Testament reading is omitted, because the psalm or canticle is often unrelated to the New Testament reading.

On the Sundays after Trinity, the Gospel reading and the New Testament reading follow separate tracks, and there are two alternative tracks for the Old Testament reading and the psalm, as explained in Common Worship:

> Those under the heading 'Continuous' allow the Old Testament reading and its complementary psalm to stand independently of the other readings. Those under the heading 'Related' relate the Old Testament reading and the psalm to the Gospel reading.

Those who prefer the readings to cohere can have their wishes partially satisfied by opting for the 'Related' Old Testament reading (and psalm), which is related to the Gospel reading. But the cost of this is that it prevents the Old Testament from speaking so clearly with its own voice, and there is no 'Related' alternative reading from the New Testament.

## Notes

Psalm references are to the Common Worship psalter. Where the versification is different in standard English versions of the Bible, this is indicated by 'EV'.

Depending on the day of the week for Christmas and Epiphany, and the date of Easter, lectionary provision for days marked with * might not be used in any given year. Other days might also be interfered with for various reasons.

# Easter

A reading from Acts is included at every service between Easter Day and Pentecost.

Gospel readings between Easter Day and Pentecost are exclusively from John's Gospel (continuing to Trinity Sunday in Years B and C), except on the Easter 3 in Years A and B, on Ascension Day, and except for the alternative readings for Easter Day (which duplicate those for the Easter Vigil). Furthermore, on the Easter 5, 6 and 7 (and on Pentecost in Years B and C, and Trinity in Year C), the readings are from the 'farewell discourse' (John 13-17).

## Easter Vigil

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the Gospel reading.

* **Genesis 1.1 â€“ 2.4a** ... **Psalm 136.1-9, 23-26** ...
* **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 4, spread over three weeks in Year A, Easter 4-6), picks up on the resurrection of Jesus being like passing through the waters of the flood. The dove points towards the gift of the Spirit at Pentecost. **Psalm 46** ...
* **Genesis 22.1-18** (also the alternative _alternative_ first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) ... **Psalm 16** ...
* **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 2) draws on the connection between Israel passing through the Red Sea and Jesus passing through death to new life. The canticle **Exodus 15.1b-13, 17, 18** continues the theme.
* **Isaiah 55.1-11** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year B) ... **Isaiah 12.2-6** ...
* **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 â€“ 4.4** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) ... (**Proverbs 8.1-8, 19-21; 9.4b-6** ...) **Psalm 19** ...
* **Ezekiel 36.24-28** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 7) ... **Psalm 42, 43** ...
* **Ezekiel 37.1-14** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year C, and Pentecost, Year B) ... **Psalm 143** ...
* **Zephaniah 3.14-20** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 3) rejoices in God's salvation, and in fortunes being restored. **Psalm 98** rejoices in God's salvation.
* **Romans 6.3-11** connects baptism with the death and resurrection of Jesus. **Psalm 114** connects this with Israel coming out of Egypt and crossing the Jordan.

Year A

* **Matthew 28.1-10** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Matthew's account of the discovery of the empty tomb, and the appearance of the risen Jesus to the women.

Year B

* **Mark 16.1-8** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Mark's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

Year C

* **Luke 24.1-12** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Luke's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

## Easter Day

Year A

* **Acts 10.34-43** (Years A, B and C) begins a (vaguely sequential) series in Acts, and features Peter telling Cornelius about Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24** (Years A, B and C) reflects the theme of resurrection: 'I shall not die, but live ... The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone'.
* **John 20.1-18** (Years A, B and C) begins a series in John, and is John's account of the discovery of the empty tomb, and the appearance of the risen Jesus to Mary Magdalene.
* (For the alternative, **Matthew 28.1-10**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year B

* **Acts 10.34-43**: see Year A.
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24**: see Year A.

Year C

* **Acts 10.34-43**: see Year A.
* (The alternative first reading, **Isaiah 65.17-25** reflects the connection between resurrection and new creation.)
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24**: see Year A.
* **1 Corinthians 15.19-26** is one of the portions of the chapter proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus (see also Year B, and the Year C Sundays in February).
* **John 20.1-18**: see Year A.
* (For the alternative, **Luke 24.1-12**, see Easter Vigil.)

## The Second Sunday of Easter

Year A

* (For the alternative first reading, **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **John 20.19-31** (Years A, B and C) continues (directly) the series in John, with Jesus' appearances on Easter evening and a week later.

* **Psalm 118.14-29** largely duplicates last week's psalm. Perhaps this is why an alternative is provided: **Psalm 150**, which is a joyful expression of praise for God's mighty acts.
* **Revelation 1.4-8** begins a (sparse but sequential) series in Revelation, covering every 'Sunday of Easter'.
* **John 20.19-31**: see Year A.

## The Third Sunday of Easter

Years A and B interrupt the Easter series in John with an excursion into Luke 24.

Year A

* (For the alternative first reading, **Zephaniah 3.14-20**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year B

* (For the alternative first reading, **Zephaniah 3.14-20**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year C

* **Psalm 30** is a life-from-death psalm (perhaps reflecting Saul's experience).
* **Revelation 5.11-14** continues the series in Revelation, and gives glory to the slain-but-living Lamb.
* **John 21.1-19** concludes the post-resurrection sub-series in John (extending the readings beyond John 20, unlike Years A and B).

## The Fourth Sunday of Easter

The theme of Jesus as the shepherd dominates, with Gospel readings from John 10, and with Psalm 23 included every year. (This Sunday is sometimes known as 'Good Shepherd Sunday'.)

Year A

* **John 10.1-10** continues the series in John, and introduces the theme of the sheep and the shepherd (although Jesus here is the gate). Jesus has come to give life to the sheep. **Psalm 23** continues the shepherd theme, and is grounded in the resurrection of Jesus, because of which we need not fear when we 'walk through the valley of the shadow of death'.

Year B

* (For the alternative first reading, **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year C

* **Acts 9.36-43** continues the series in Acts, and shows that Jesus' power to raise the dead is active through his apostle Peter. The resurrection leads to the growth of the church.

* **John 10.22-30** continues the series in John, and says that Jesus gives life to his sheep. **Psalm 23** continues the shepherd theme: see Year A. **Revelation 7.9-17** continues the series in Revelation, and features the Lamb, whose blood has been shed, but who is alive, and is described as a shepherd.

## The Fifth Sunday of Easter

Year A

* (The alternative first reading, **Genesis 8.1-19**, continues the series on the flood in Genesis. The dove points towards the gift of the Spirit at Pentecost.)

Year B

* (For the alternative first reading, **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 â€“ 4.4**, or **Genesis 22.1-18**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year C

* **Acts 11.1-18** continues the series in Acts, recounting the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles. **Psalm 148** invites 'all peoples' and all creation to 'Praise the Lord'.
* (For the alternative first reading, **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 â€“ 4.4**, or **Genesis 22.1-18**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **Revelation 21.1-6** continues the series in Revelation, featuring the end of death.
* **John 13.31-35** continues the series in John, and begins a series on the 'farewell discourse', which continues on Sundays until Pentecost. Jesus begins to prepare his disciples for his departure.

Year A

* (The alternative first reading, **Genesis 8.20 â€“ 9.17**, concludes the series on the flood in Genesis.)

Year B

* (For the alternative first reading, **Isaiah 55.1-11**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year C

* **Acts 16.9-15** continues the series in Acts, recounting Lydia's conversion, as the risen Jesus opens her heart, and as the gospel advances into Europe.
* (For the alternative first reading, **Ezekiel 37.1-14**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **Psalm 67** picks up the Rogation theme, asking for a good harvest, but also calls for the nations to praise God, which links with the reading from Acts.
* **Revelation 21.10, 22 â€“ 22.5** continues the series on Revelation, focusing on the Holy City.
* **John 14.23-29** continues the series in John's 'farewell discourse', looking ahead to the gift of the Spirit.
* (The alternative, **John 5.1-9**, recounts the healing at the pool in Bethesda. Presumably there is a good reason for this.)

## Ascension Day

* **Acts 1.1-11** recounts Jesus' ascension.
* (The alternative first reading, **Daniel 7.9-14**, has the Son of Man approaching the Ancient of Days and being given authority.)

Year C

* **Proverbs 8.1-4, 22-31** presents wisdom, personified, through whom God made the world, hinting towards the Trinity.
