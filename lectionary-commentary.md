**_Work in progress!_**

This is a commentary on the _lectionary_, not a commentary on the _passages_. The aim is to answer the question: _Why was this passage chosen?_

Note that there is often no 'theme' tying the readings together. (Many people persist in looking for one, even decades after the ASB.) Where readings are closely related, they are grouped together below. In many cases, however, a particular reading will not be related to other readings on the same day, but it will turn out to be part of a series on a particular book of the Bible running over several weeks. This principle of continuous (or semicontinuous) reading of Scripture is one of the key principles behind the lectionary.

**Common Worship** was introduced in the Church of England in 2000. It includes a [Lectionary for Sundays, Principal Feasts and Holy Days, and Festivals](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary), which provides a lectionary for three services on each of those days: Principal Service, Second Service, and Third Service (along with 'Evening Prayer on the Eve' for some occasions). This page covers the **Principal Service Lectionary**, which is drawn (with modifications) from the ecumenical **Revised Common Lectionary (RCL)**.

Most of the comments below are 'reverse engineered' using the lectionary and a fair bit of guesswork, so they should not be taken as authoritative.

**_Work in progress!_**

* Year A: complete for Advent and Christmas Day
* Year B: hardly begun
* Year C: complete from Easter Day onwards
* Festivals: complete from September to November

## The Bible and the lectionary

For the Gospels, Year A focuses on Matthew, Year B on Mark, and Year C on Luke. John is read in Years A, B and C, mostly during the seasons (especially Easter), but with some appearances in Ordinary Time in Year B (such as a summer series on John 6). During the Sundays in Ordinary Time (excluding the two before Lent), the readings in Matthew, Mark and Luke are sequential (semicontinuous), with just one exception (Year B, 3 before Advent, Mark 1.14-20). This covers the bulk of each gospel (Matthew 5-25, Mark 1-13 and Luke 5-21, plus a bit of 23). Material from Matthew 1-4, Mark 1 and Luke 1-4 is included in Advent, Christmas, Epiphany and Lent (along with extracts from other chapters), and the resurrection accounts are included during Easter. Note that the Passion narratives (Matthew 26-27, Mark 14-15 and Luke 22-23), with one or two small exceptions, are included _only_ on Palm Sunday, within the Liturgy of the Passion.

Acts is read only at the Baptism of Christ, between Easter Day and Pentecost, and on some Festivals.

Old Testament 'Continuous' readings after Trinity, cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A (Pentateuch): Genesis, Exodus and Deuteronomy 34
* Year B (History and Wisdom): 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings (up to chapter 8), and selections from Song of Solomon, Proverbs, Esther and Job
* Year C (Prophets): 1 Kings 17 &ndash; 2 Kings 5 (Elijah and Elisha), Amos, Hosea, Isaiah (briefly!), Jeremiah, Lamentations, Joel

New Testament readings after Trinity and before Advent cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A: Romans, Philippians and 1 Thessalonians
* Year B: 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, James and Hebrews 1-10
* Year C: Galatians, Colossians, Hebrews 11-13, Philemon, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and 2 Thessalonians

What about the rest of the Bible (apart from the Gospels and the Psalms)? As well as cameo appearances during seasons and Festivals, and 'Related' Old Testament readings after Trinity, the Bible is read systematically as follows:

* Old Testament
  * Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Jonah, Micah, Zephaniah and Malachi: included, but not in a systematic way
  * Judges, Ruth, Ezra, Obadiah, Nahum and Haggai: not included
  * 1 and 2 Chronicles: not included (outside Festivals)
  * Ecclesiastes, Habakkuk and Zechariah: once as a 'Related' reading
  * Isaiah: features prominently in Advent, Christmas and Epiphany, and at other times (not sequential)
* New Testament
  * Acts: Easter season, Years A, B and C (vaguely sequential)
  * 1 Corinthians:
    * Year A: chapters 1-3 after Epiphany and in February
    * Year B: chapter 9 for two Sundays in February
    * Year C: chapters 12-13 for two Sundays in Epiphany, followed by chapter 15 for three Sundays in February
  * Titus: no systematic readings
  * 1 Peter: Easter season, Year A
  * 2 Peter: no systematic readings
  * 1 John: Easter season, Year B
  * 2 John, 3 John, Jude: not included
  * Revelation: Easter season, Year C (also three Sundays in Epiphany, Year B, not sequential)

## Choosing between the readings

It is worth noting rule 5 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a), which gives permission to extend the readings:

> In a compact cycle of readings such as these, some passages have necessarily been abbreviated. When opportunity allows, the passages may be read in full. Verses in brackets may be included or omitted, as desired.

Each service has the following readings:

* **Old Testament reading** (or sometimes a reading from Acts),
* **psalm or canticle** (usually a response to the first reading),
* **New Testament reading** (from an epistle or Revelation), and
* **Gospel reading**.

The psalm or canticle should normally be used, along with two or three of the other readings. When using just two of the other readings, Common Worship specifies:

> When there are only two readings at the principal service and that service is Holy Communion, the second reading is always the Gospel reading. ...
>
> When the Principal Service Lectionary is used at a service other than Holy Communion, the Gospel reading need not always be chosen.

In addition, when the first reading is from Acts, it must be included as one of the readings.

Note that in Common Worship Holy Communion (Order One or Two), 'Either one or two readings from Scripture precede the Gospel reading', and 'The psalm or canticle follows the first reading'. As the psalm or canticle is usually related to the Old Testament reading, this makes a lot of sense when that reading is used; it makes less sense when the Old Testament reading is omitted, because the psalm or canticle is often unrelated to the New Testament reading.

On the Sundays after Trinity, the Gospel reading and the New Testament reading follow separate tracks, and there are two alternative tracks for the Old Testament reading and the psalm, as explained in Common Worship:

> Those under the heading 'Continuous' allow the Old Testament reading and its complementary psalm to stand independently of the other readings. Those under the heading 'Related' relate the Old Testament reading and the psalm to the Gospel reading.

Those who prefer the readings to cohere can have their wishes partially satisfied by opting for the 'Related' Old Testament reading (and psalm), which is related to the Gospel reading. But the cost of this is that it prevents the Old Testament from speaking so clearly with its own voice, and there is no 'Related' alternative reading from the New Testament.

## Notes

Psalm references are to the Common Worship psalter. Where the versification is different in standard English versions of the Bible, this is indicated by 'EV'. Quotations are drawn from the Common Worship psalter or the NRSV.

Depending on the day of the week for Christmas and Epiphany, and the date of Easter, lectionary provision for days marked with * might not be used in any given year. Other days might also be displaced for various reasons.

# Advent

## The First Sunday of Advent

The Gospel readings all speak of the 'coming' of 'the Son of Man'.

Year A

* **Matthew 24.36-44** urges us to 'be ready' for 'the coming of the Son of Man'. **Romans 13.11-14** is an exhortation to 'lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light' because 'the day is near'. **Isaiah 2.1-5** is the first of four readings (a series?) in the first part of Isaiah, and urges God's people to 'walk in the light of the Lord', looking ahead to 'days to come' when the nations stream to God's house in Zion in order to walk in God's paths and find peace with each other. **Psalm 122** has people going up to 'the house of the Lord' and speaks of 'peace'.

## The Second Sunday of Advent

The Gospel readings all introduce John the Baptist.

Year A

* **Matthew 3.1-12** introduces John the Baptist baptizing with water for repentance and pointing towards one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. **Isaiah 11.1-10** continues in Isaiah, and speaks one who will come with the 'spirit of the Lord' and bring peace. **Psalm 72.1-7, 18-19** speaks of the 'king' bringing 'justice' and 'peace'. **Romans 15.4-13** quotes Isaiah 11.10 and speaks of hope.

## The Third Sunday of Advent

The Gospel readings all continue with John the Baptist.

Year A

* **Matthew 11.2-11** has Jesus sending a message to John the Baptist about blind eyes being opened, and speaking about John the Baptist preparing the way. **Isaiah 35.1-10** continues in Isaiah, and is about God coming, reversing fortunes, strengthening the weak, opening the eyes of the blind, and a 'highway' being there. **Psalm 146.4-10** (EV: 5-10) says, 'the Lord opens the eyes of the blind'. Alternatively, the canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, which is about fortunes being reversed. **James 5.7-10** says, 'Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.'

## The Fourth Sunday of Advent

The Gospel readings all look towards Jesus' birth to Mary.

Year A

* **Matthew 1.18-25** leads up to the birth of Jesus to Mary, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about 'Emmanuel'. **Isaiah 7.10-16** continues in Isaiah, and looks ahead to a young woman bearing a son and calling him Immanuel. **Psalm 80.1-8, 18-20 (EV: 1-7, 17-19)** calls on God to 'come to our salvation' and 'show the light of your countenance', and speaks of 'the man at your right hand, the son of man you made so strong for yourself'. **Romans 1.1-7** says that Jesus 'was descended from David according to the flesh'.

# Christmas

## Christmas Day

* **Luke 2.1-14 [15-20]** is about Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, the angels appearing to the shepherds and announcing the birth of a Saviour, [and the shepherds going to Bethlehem to 'see'].

Set II (emphasis on God's glory appearing and being seen)

* **Isaiah 62.6-12** begins by speaking of king and nations who will 'see ... your glory', and says to Zion, 'See, your salvation comes'.
* **Psalm 97** says of the Lord that 'all the peoples have seen his glory'.
* **Titus 3.4-7** speaks of 'when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Saviour appeared'.
* **Luke 2.[1-7] 8-20** is about [Jesus' birth in Bethlehem], the angels appearing to the shepherds and announcing the birth of a Saviour, and the shepherds going to Bethlehem to 'see'.

Set III (emphasis on Jesus' divinity)

* **Isaiah 52.7-10** speaks of 'the return of the Lord to Zion', and says that he 'has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations'.

* **Luke 5.1-11** begins a semicontinuous series in Luke 5-21 (plus a bit of 23), which covers these three Sundays in February, and all the Sundays between Trinity and Advent. Jesus calls his first disciples. **Isaiah 6.1-8 [9-13]** continues the theme of calling, with the calling of Isaiah. Isaiah saw the Lord, 'high and lofty', in his heavenly temple, and **Psalm 138** refers to God as 'high' and speaks of his 'holy temple'.

* **Luke 6.17-26** continues the series in Luke, with the blessings and woes. **Jeremiah 17.5-10** continues the theme ('Cursed are those ...', 'Blessed are those ...'), as does **Psalm 1** ('Blessed are they ...', 'As for the wicked ...').

## Sunday between 18 and 24 February (Proper 3)*

(RCL 'Seventh Sunday after the Epiphany', 'Proper 2'.)

Year C

* **1 Corinthians 15.35-38, 42-50** concludes the series in 1 Corinthians 15, with extracts from the section on the resurrection body. (15.51-58 is the reading for the following week in the RCL.)
* **Luke 6.27-38** continues the series in Luke (without a gap), and focuses on loving one's enemies. (6.39-49 is the reading for the following week in the RCL, which is omitted in Common Worship: see discussion below. To fill in the gap, this week's reading could be extended to 6.42 'when opportunity allows'.) **Genesis 45.3-11, 15** is about Joseph's love for his brothers, who had behaved like his enemies. **Psalm 37.1-11, 40, 41** (EV: 1-11, 39, 40) calls us not to fret about evildoers.

## The Second Sunday before Lent

Creation theme.

The addition of this creation-themed week means that 'Proper 3' in the RCL is not included. The Gospel readings from that week contain several famous sayings of Jesus:

* Matthew 6.24-34...
  * Matthew 6.24 ('No one can serve two masters'): see Luke 16.1-13.
  * Matthew 6.25-34 ('do not worry'): set for this week. See also Harvest Thanksgiving.
* Mark 2.13-22 ('I have come to call not the righteous but sinners ... new wine into old wineskins'). The parallel passage in Luke 5.27-38 is also omitted, but the other parallel in Matthew 9.9-17 is partially included in Matthew 9.9-13, 18-26, and the gap could easily be filled.
* Luke 6.39-49...
  * 6.39 ('Can a blind person guide a blind person?'): see Matthew 15.14, which is included in Matthew 15.[10-20] 21-28.
  * 6.40 ('A disciple is not above the teacher'): see John 13.16, which is included on Maundy Thursday.
  * 6.41-42 ('speck ... log'): see Matthew 7.3-5, which is also omitted (last week's reading could be extended to this point).
  * 6.43-44 ('tree is known by its fruit'): see Matthew 7.16, 18, 20, which could be included by extending the reading from 7.21-29 to begin at verse 16.
  * 6.45 ('it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks'): see Matthew 12.34-35 (which is omitted) and a near parallel in Mark 7.20-23, which is (mostly) included in Mark 7.1-8, 14, 15, 21-23.
  * 6.46 ('Lord ... do what I say'): see Matthew 7.21, which is included in 7.21-29.
  * 6.47-49 ('house ... without a foundation'): see Matthew 7.24-27, which is included in 7.21-29.

# Easter

A reading from Acts is included at every service between Easter Day and Pentecost.

Gospel readings between Easter Day and Pentecost are exclusively from John's Gospel (continuing to Trinity Sunday in Years B and C), except on Easter 3 in Years A and B, on Ascension Day, and except for the alternative readings for Easter Day (which duplicate those for the Easter Vigil). Furthermore, on Easter 5, 6 and 7 (and on Pentecost in Years B and C, and Trinity in Year C), the readings are from the 'farewell discourse' (John 13-17).

## Easter Vigil

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the Gospel reading.

* **Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.4a** ... **Psalm 136.1-9, 23-26** ...
* **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 4, spread over three weeks in Year A, Easter 4-6), picks up on the resurrection of Jesus being like passing through the waters of the flood. The dove points towards the gift of the Spirit at Pentecost. **Psalm 46** ...
* **Genesis 22.1-18** (also the alternative _alternative_ first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) ... **Psalm 16** ...
* **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 2) draws on the connection between Israel passing through the Red Sea and Jesus passing through death to new life. The canticle **Exodus 15.1b-13, 17, 18** continues the theme.
* **Isaiah 55.1-11** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year B) ... **Isaiah 12.2-6** ...
* **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 &ndash; 4.4** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) ... (**Proverbs 8.1-8, 19-21; 9.4b-6** ...) **Psalm 19** ...
* **Ezekiel 36.24-28** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 7) ... **Psalm 42, 43** ...
* **Ezekiel 37.1-14** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year C, and Pentecost, Year B) ... **Psalm 143** ...
* **Zephaniah 3.14-20** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 3) rejoices in God's salvation, and in fortunes being restored. **Psalm 98** rejoices in God's salvation.
* **Romans 6.3-11** connects baptism with the death and resurrection of Jesus. **Psalm 114** connects this with Israel coming out of Egypt and crossing the Jordan.

Year A

* **Matthew 28.1-10** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Matthew's account of the discovery of the empty tomb, and the appearance of the risen Jesus to the women.

Year B

* **Mark 16.1-8** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Mark's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

Year C

* **Luke 24.1-12** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Luke's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

## Easter Day

Year A

* **Acts 10.34-43** (Years A, B and C) begins a (vaguely sequential) series in Acts, and features Peter telling Cornelius about Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24** (Years A, B and C) reflects the theme of resurrection: 'I shall not die, but live ... The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone'.
* **John 20.1-18** (Years A, B and C) begins a series in John, and is John's account of the discovery of the empty tomb, and the appearance of the risen Jesus to Mary Magdalene.
* (For the alternative, **Matthew 28.1-10**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year B

* **Acts 10.34-43**: see Year A.
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24**: see Year A.
* **John 20.1-18**: see Year A.
* (For the alternative, **Mark 16.1-8**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year C

* **Acts 10.34-43**: see Year A.
* (The alternative first reading, **Isaiah 65.17-25** reflects the connection between resurrection and new creation.)
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24**: see Year A.
* **1 Corinthians 15.19-26** is one of the portions of the chapter proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus (see also Year B, and the Year C Sundays in February).
* **John 20.1-18**: see Year A.
* (For the alternative, **Luke 24.1-12**, see Easter Vigil.)

## The Second Sunday of Easter

Year A

* (For the alternative first reading, **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **John 20.19-31** (Years A, B and C) continues (directly) the series in John, with Jesus' appearances on Easter evening and a week later.

Year B

* **John 20.19-31**: see Year A.

Year C

* (For the alternative first reading, **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **Psalm 118.14-29** largely duplicates last week's psalm. Perhaps this is why an alternative is provided: **Psalm 150**, which is a joyful expression of praise for God's mighty acts.
* **Revelation 1.4-8** begins a (sparse but sequential) series in Revelation, covering every 'Sunday of Easter'.
* **John 20.19-31**: see Year A.

## The Third Sunday of Easter

Years A and B interrupt the Easter series in John with an excursion into Luke 24.

Year A

* (For the alternative first reading, **Zephaniah 3.14-20**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year B

* (For the alternative first reading, **Zephaniah 3.14-20**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year C

* **Acts 9.1-6 [7-20]** continues the series in Acts, and describes Jesus' activity after his resurrection and ascension in relation to Saul, bringing about a kind of death-to-life transformation.
* (For the alternative first reading, **Zephaniah 3.14-20**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **Psalm 30** is a life-from-death psalm (perhaps reflecting Saul's experience).
* **Revelation 5.11-14** continues the series in Revelation, and gives glory to the slain-but-living Lamb.
* **John 21.1-19** concludes the post-resurrection sub-series in John (extending the readings beyond John 20, unlike Years A and B).

## The Fourth Sunday of Easter

The theme of Jesus as the shepherd dominates, with Gospel readings from John 10, and with Psalm 23 included every year. (This Sunday is sometimes known as 'Good Shepherd Sunday'.)

Year A

* (The alternative first reading, **Genesis 7**, begins a series on the flood in Genesis, expanding the alternative reading for Years B and C. The resurrection of Jesus is like passing through the waters of the flood.)
* **John 10.1-10** continues the series in John, and introduces the theme of the sheep and the shepherd (although Jesus here is the gate). Jesus has come to give life to the sheep. **Psalm 23** continues the shepherd theme, and is grounded in the resurrection of Jesus, because of which we need not fear when we 'walk through the valley of the shadow of death'.

Year B

* (For the alternative first reading, **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **John 10.11-18** continues the series in John, and says that Jesus is the good shepherd who lays down his life and takes it back up again. **Psalm 23** continues the shepherd theme: see Year A.

Year C

* **Acts 9.36-43** continues the series in Acts, and shows that Jesus' power to raise the dead is active through his apostle Peter. The resurrection leads to the growth of the church.
* (For the alternative first reading, **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **John 10.22-30** continues the series in John, and says that Jesus gives life to his sheep. **Psalm 23** continues the shepherd theme: see Year A. **Revelation 7.9-17** continues the series in Revelation, and features the Lamb, whose blood has been shed, but who is alive, and is described as a shepherd.

## The Fifth Sunday of Easter

Year A

* (The alternative first reading, **Genesis 8.1-19**, continues the series on the flood in Genesis. The dove points towards the gift of the Spirit at Pentecost.)

Year B

* (For the alternative first reading, **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 &ndash; 4.4**, or **Genesis 22.1-18**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year C

* **Acts 11.1-18** continues the series in Acts, recounting the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles. **Psalm 148** invites 'all peoples' and all creation to 'Praise the Lord'.
* (For the alternative first reading, **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 &ndash; 4.4**, or **Genesis 22.1-18**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **Revelation 21.1-6** continues the series in Revelation, featuring the end of death.
* **John 13.31-35** continues the series in John, and begins a series on the 'farewell discourse', which continues on Sundays until Pentecost. Jesus begins to prepare his disciples for his departure.

## The Sixth Sunday of Easter

As the Sunday before the Rogation Days (the weekdays before Ascension Day), this is often observed as 'Rogation Sunday', with a focus on asking for God's blessing on the crops. ('Rogation' comes from Latin _rogare_, to ask.)

Year A

* (The alternative first reading, **Genesis 8.20 &ndash; 9.17**, concludes the series on the flood in Genesis.)

Year B

* (For the alternative first reading, **Isaiah 55.1-11**, see Easter Vigil.)

Year C

* **Acts 16.9-15** continues the series in Acts, recounting Lydia's conversion, as the risen Jesus opens her heart, and as the gospel advances into Europe.
* (For the alternative first reading, **Ezekiel 37.1-14**, see Easter Vigil.)
* **Psalm 67** picks up the Rogation theme, asking for a good harvest, but also calls for the nations to praise God, which links with the reading from Acts.
* **Revelation 21.10, 22 &ndash; 22.5** continues the series on Revelation, focusing on the Holy City.
* **John 14.23-29** continues the series in John's 'farewell discourse', looking ahead to the gift of the Spirit.
* (The alternative, **John 5.1-9**, recounts the healing at the pool in Bethesda. Presumably there is a good reason for this.)

## Ascension Day

* **Acts 1.1-11** recounts Jesus' ascension.

Year C

* **Isaiah 1.1, 10-20** continues the series on the prophets, and is the first of two weeks in Isaiah (moving on chronologically from Hosea).

## Sunday between 4 and 10 September (Proper 18)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 18.1-11** continues the series on the prophets and in Jeremiah (out of sequence, perhaps to maintain a thematic sequence from warning to judgment, and perhaps chosen to fit with the Gospel reading and its themes of choice and consequences).

* **Philemon 1-21** is Paul's appeal for runaway slave Onesimus. Perhaps it appears here because it mentions Timothy (see next week).
* **Luke 14.25-33** continues the series in Luke, and is about the cost of being a disciple. (14.34-35 could be included for completeness 'when opportunity allows'.) The 'Related' reading, **Deuteronomy 30.15-20** calls its hearers to consider the benefits that follow when they 'choose life', and the curses that follow when they do not.

The 'Related' reading, **Exodus 32.7-14**, is about God forgiving sinners, after the incident with the golden calf. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 51.1-11** (EV: 1-10), is about the forgiveness of sins.

* **1 Timothy 6.6-19** concludes the series in 1 Timothy, with a call to 'Fight the good fight of the faith', and with teaching about riches (which &ndash; coincidentally? &ndash; fits well with the Gospel reading).
* **Luke 16.19-31** continues the series in Luke, with the rich man and Lazarus. The 'Related' reading, **Amos 6.1a, 4-7**, is a warning for the rich. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 146**, warns that princes will perish, but promises 'bread to those who hunger'.

Year C

* **2 Timothy 1.1-14** begins a four-week series in 2 Timothy, with a call to remain faithful to the gospel.
* **Luke 17.5-10** continues the series in Luke, with teaching about faith and duty. The 'Related' reading, **Habakkuk 1.1-4; 2.1-4**, features the prophet's faith being increased (perhaps).

## Sunday between 9 and 15 October (Proper 23)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 29.1, 4-7** continues the series on the prophets and in Jeremiah, and is a word of comfort and assurance for God's people in exile (out of sequence, presumably for thematic reasons).

  * Luke 17.33: various parallels.
  * Luke 17.34-35[36]: see Matthew 24.36-44.
  * Luke 17.37: omitted, along with its parallel in Matthew 24.28

## Sunday between 16 and 22 October (Proper 24)

Year C

* **Jeremiah 31.27-34** continues the series on the prophets and concludes the series in Jeremiah, with the promise of a new covenant: 'I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts'. **Psalm 119.97-104** begins, 'Lord, how I love your law!'
* **2 Timothy 3.14 &ndash; 4.5** continues the series in 2 Timothy, with a call to faithful proclamation.
* **Luke 18.1-8** continues the series in Luke, with the parable of the persistent widow. The 'Related' reading, **Genesis 32.22-31**, is about Jacob's persistence with God. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 121**, is about looking to the Lord for help.

## Sunday between 23 and 29 October (Proper 25)

Omitted if Bible Sunday is observed.

Year C

* **Joel 2.23-32** concludes the series on the prophets, with a single extract from Joel. Joel is difficult to date, so it is unlikely that this passage is here for chronological reasons. It follows well from last week, with the promise that God will pour abundant rain on the earth, and his spirit on all flesh. **Psalm 65** is about God watering the earth abundantly.
* **2 Timothy 4.6-8, 16-18** concludes the series in 2 Timothy, with Paul looking towards his departure.
* **Luke 18.9-14** continues the series in Luke (without a gap), with the parable of the Pharisee and the tax-collector. The 'Related' reading, **Ecclesiasticus 35.12-17**, is about God listening to the prayer of the poor (the tax-collector being taken as someone who is poor, at least in spirit, presumably). The alternative 'Related' reading, **Jeremiah 14.7-10, 19-22**, is a confession of sin and a plea for God's help. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 84.1-7** (EV: 1-8), expresses a desire 'to enter the courts of the Lord', and asks God to 'hear my prayer'.
  * Luke 18.15-17: see Mark 10.2-16.
  * Luke 18.18-30: see Mark 10.17-31.
  * Luke 18.31-34: see Mark 9.30-32 for a close parallel.
  * Luke 18.35-43: see Mark 10.46-52.

## The Last Sunday after Trinity if observed as Bible Sunday

Year C

* **Isaiah 45.22-25** has God saying, 'from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall not return'.

# Festivals

According to the [Rules], Festivals are 'not usually displaced'. However,

> Festivals falling on a Sunday are to be kept on that day or transferred to the Monday (or, at the discretion of the minister, to the next suitable weekday). But a Festival may not be celebrated on Sundays in Advent, Lent or Eastertide. Festivals coinciding with a Principal Feast or Principal Holy Day are transferred to the first available day.

One of these Festivals might be Patronal Festival, which can be observed either as a Festival or as a Principal Feast. According to the [Rules],

> When kept as Principal Feasts, the Patronal and Dedication Festivals may be transferred to the nearest Sunday, unless that day is already a Principal Feast or one of the following days: the First Sunday of Advent, the Baptism of Christ, the First Sunday of Lent, the Fifth Sunday of Lent or Palm Sunday.

If it falls on one of those days, it must be transferred.

## The Naming and Circumcision of Jesus (1 January)

## The Conversion of Paul (25 January)

## Joseph of Nazareth (19 March)

19 March always falls during Lent. According to the [Rules],

> When St Joseph’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter or, if the Annunciation has already been moved to that date, to the first available day thereafter.

## The Annunciation of Our Lord to the Blessed Virgin Mary (25 March)

This is a Principal Feast, but it comes across as somewhat unwanted, as it is never celebrated on a Sunday. 25 March always fall during Lent, or very occasionally on or just after Easter Day. According to the [Rules],

> the Annunciation, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to the Monday following or, falling between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.

## George, Martyr, Patron of England (23 April)

23 April always falls during or just before Easter season (Easter always falls between 22 March and 25 April), so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast). According to the [Rules],

> When St George’s Day or St Mark’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter. If both fall in this period, St George’s Day is transferred to the Monday and St Mark’s Day to the Tuesday.

## Mark the Evangelist (25 April)

25 April always falls during Easter season, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast). See above on George (23 April).

## Philip and James, Apostles (1 May)

1 May always falls during Easter season, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

## Matthias the Apostle (14 May)

14 May always falls between Easter and Trinity, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

## The Visit of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Elizabeth (31 May)

31 May usually falls between Easter and Trinity, so this Festival can rarely be celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

## Barnabas the Apostle (11 June)

11 June occasionally falls before Trinity (20 June at the latest).

## The Birth of John the Baptist (24 June)

## Peter and Paul, Apostles (29 June)

## Thomas the Apostle (3 July)

## Mary Magdalene (22 July)

## James the Apostle (25 July)

## The Transfiguration of Our Lord (6 August)

## The Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August)

## Bartholomew the Apostle (24 August)

## Holy Cross Day (14 September)

This is also known as the Feast of the 'Exaltation of the Cross', and has its origins in more than one event associated with the cross and Jerusalem. The theme of exaltation is reflected in the readings.

* **Psalm 22.23-28** expresses praise to the Lord, who 'has not despised nor abhorred the suffering of the poor', which fits with the theme of the crucified one being exalted.
* **Philippians 2.6-11** is about Christ humbling himself to 'death on a cross' and subsequently being exalted.
* **John 3.13-17** is about the Son of Man being 'lifted up', 'just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness'. **Numbers 21.4-9** is about the bronze serpent.

## Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist (21 September)

Matthew was a tax-collector. This is reflected in the readings.

* **Proverbs 3.13-18** says that wisdom is better than silver and gold.
* **Psalm 119.65-72** says that God's law is 'dearer to me than a hoard of gold and silver'.
* **2 Corinthians 4.1-6** has several possible connections with Matthew: renouncing 'shameful things', the 'open statement of the truth' (in writing his Gospel), light shining into Matthew's heart.
* **Matthew 9.9-13** tells of Jesus calling Matthew the tax-collector to follow him, and of Jesus eating with 'tax-collectors and sinners'.

## Michael and All Angels (29 September)

Michael the archangel is mentioned four times in Scripture: Daniel 10.13-21 and 12.1, Jude 9 and Revelation 12.7.

* **Genesis 28.10-17** is Jacob's dream of a 'ladder' with 'the angels of God ... ascending and descending on it', which is echoed in the Gospel reading. See below for the alternative, **Revelation 12.7-12**.
* **Psalm 103.19-22** says, 'Bless the Lord, you angels of his'.
* **Revelation 12.7-12** is about 'Michael and his angels' fighting against 'the dragon ... and his angels'. Alternatively, the passage from Revelation can be the first reading, with **Hebrews 1.5-14** as the second reading, contrasting angels with the Son (see 1.1-4 and 2.1-4).
* **John 1.47-51** has Jesus saying to Nathanael, 'you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man', echoing the Old Testament reading.

## Luke the Evangelist (18 October)

Luke was a 'physician' (Colossians 4.14). This is reflected in the readings. (Elsewhere, Luke is mentioned by name only in 2 Timothy 4.11 and Philemon 24.)

* **Isaiah 35.3-6** is about the restoration of health. Alternatively, **Acts 16.6-12a** contains the first 'we' of the narrative, subtly indicating the point at which Luke joined Paul and his companions.
* **Psalm 147.1-7** says that the Lord 'heals the brokenhearted and binds up all their wounds'.
* **2 Timothy 4.5-17** says, 'Only Luke is with me.'
* **Luke 10.1-9** is about the mission of the seventy, which perhaps speaks more directly to those (such as Luke) who are not numbered among the Twelve. They were sent out to 'cure the sick' and to speak of the 'kingdom of God', which is appropriate to Luke as a physician and the author of one of the Gospels.

## Simon and Jude, Apostles (28 October)

Simon, one of the Twelve (not Peter), appears as 'the Cananaean' in Matthew 10.4 and Mark 3.18, and as 'the Zealot' in Luke 6.15 and Acts 1.13.

Jude, one of the Twelve, is mentioned as 'Judas son of James' in Luke 6.16 and Acts 1.13, as 'Judas (not Iscariot)' when he asks a question in John 14.22, and (presumably) as 'Thaddaeus' (or 'Lebbaeus') in Matthew 10.3 and as 'Thaddaeus' in Mark 3.18. The Greek behind 'son of James' is simply 'of James', which has historically led many (especially in the West) to identify this Jude with the author of the Epistle of Jude (who describes himself as 'Jude ... brother of James'), who is identified with 'Judas', a brother of Jesus, mentioned in Matthew 13.55 and Mark 6.3.

According to tradition, Simon and Jude worked together as evangelists and were martyred together.

* **Ephesians 2.19-22** speaks of the church as being 'built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone'. **Isaiah 28.14-16** has God speaking of 'a foundation stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation'. **Psalm 119.89-96** reflects the theme of foundations: the Lord's word 'stands firm', the Lord has 'established the earth', and the Lord's 'judgements stand firm'.
* **John 15.17-27** reflects Simon and Jude's calling, by speaking of persecution and of Jesus' command to his disciples to 'testify'.

## Andrew the Apostle (30 November)

30 November, if it is a Sunday, falls during Advent, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

'In the Anglican Communion, St Andrewstide is widely observed by intercessions for foreign missions.'[^Andrew] This is the emphasis in the readings.

* **Romans 10.12-18** is about the good news being proclaimed 'to all the earth', echoing Jesus' call to Andrew. The other two readings are quoted: **Isaiah 52.7-10** ('How beautiful ... are the feet') and **Psalm 19.1-6** ('... their words to the ends of the world').
* **Matthew 4.18-22** has Jesus calling two pairs of brothers as his first followers: Simon Peter and Andrew, followed by James and John. To the first pair, Jesus says, 'Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.'

## Stephen, Deacon, First Martyr (26 December)

## John, Apostle and Evangelist (27 December)

## The Holy Innocents (28 December)

## Dedication Festival

According to the [Rules],

> The Dedication Festival of a church is the anniversary of the date of its dedication or consecration. This is kept either as a Festival or as a Principal Feast.
>
> When the date of dedication is unknown, the Dedication Festival may be observed on the first Sunday in October, or on the Last Sunday after Trinity, or on a suitable date chosen locally.
>
> When kept as Principal Feasts, the Patronal and Dedication Festivals may be transferred to the nearest Sunday, unless that day is already a Principal Feast or one of the following days: the First Sunday of Advent, the Baptism of Christ, the First Sunday of Lent, the Fifth Sunday of Lent or Palm Sunday.
