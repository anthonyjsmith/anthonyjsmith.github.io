A commentary on the _Common Worship_ Principal Service Lectionary.

This is a commentary on the _lectionary_, not a commentary on the _passages_. The aim is to answer the question: _Why was this passage chosen?_

Simply navigate or search for the relevant day, e.g., 'Advent 1', 'Proper 21', 'Bartholomew'.

Most of the comments below are 'reverse engineered' using the lectionary and a fair bit of guesswork, so they should not be taken as authoritative.

# Introduction

**_Common Worship_** was introduced in the Church of England in 2000. It includes a [Lectionary for Sundays, Principal Feasts and Holy Days, and Festivals][Lectionary], which provides a lectionary for three services on each of those days: Principal Service, Second Service, and Third Service (along with 'Evening Prayer on the Eve' for some occasions). This page covers the **Principal Service Lectionary**, which is drawn (with modifications) from the ecumenical **_Revised Common Lectionary_ (_RCL_)**.

Note that there is often no 'theme' tying the readings together. (Many people persist in looking for one, even decades after the _ASB_.) Where readings are closely related, they are grouped together below. In many cases, however, a particular reading will not be related to other readings on the same day, but it will turn out to be part of a series on a particular book of the Bible running over several weeks. This principle of continuous (or semicontinuous) reading of Scripture is one of the key principles behind the lectionary.

## The Bible and the lectionary {#bible}

I have put the Principal Service Lectionary into a [spreadsheet](/assets/lectionary.xlsx), including a 'reverse lectionary' as the second sheet (listing the passages in biblical order).

For the Gospels, Year A focuses on Matthew, Year B on Mark, and Year C on Luke.

John is read in all three years, mostly during the seasons (especially Easter), but with some appearances in Ordinary Time in Year B (such as a summer series on John 6).

The Gospel readings on Sundays during Ordinary Time work semicontinuously through the central portions of Matthew, Mark and Luke. More precisely, this actually begins just before Ordinary Time, in Epiphany 3, with the start of Jesus' public ministry (or at least, it does in the _RCL_: see notes on Epiphany 3), continuing into February until 3 before Lent, and then the series resumes after Trinity, continuing until the Sunday before Advent. (The one exception is Year B, 3 before Advent, Mark 1.14-20.) Material from Matthew 1.1 &ndash; 4.11, Mark 1.1-13 and Luke 1.1 &ndash; 4.13 is included in Advent, Christmas, Epiphany 1 and Lent (along with extracts from other chapters), and the resurrection accounts are included during Easter. Note that the Passion narratives (Matthew 26-27, Mark 14-15 and Luke 22-23), with one or two small exceptions, are included _only_ on Palm Sunday, within the Liturgy of the Passion. See the [Appendix](#appendixgospels) for details.

Acts is read at the Baptism of Christ, between Easter Day and Pentecost (vaguely sequentially), and on some Festivals.

Numerous Psalms are included.

Many other books are read semicontinuously, while also featuring in a non-sequential way during seasons and Festivals and as 'Related' Old Testament readings after Trinity.

Old Testament 'Continuous' readings after Trinity cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A (Pentateuch): Genesis, Exodus and Deuteronomy 34
* Year B (History and Wisdom): 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings (up to chapter 8), and selections from Song of Solomon, Proverbs, Esther and Job
* Year C (Prophets): 1 Kings 17 &ndash; 2 Kings 5 (Elijah and Elisha), Amos, Hosea, Isaiah (briefly!), Jeremiah, Lamentations and Joel

New Testament readings after Trinity and before Advent cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A: Romans, Philippians and 1 Thessalonians
* Year B: 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, James and Hebrews 1-10
* Year C: Galatians, Colossians, Hebrews 11-13, Philemon, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and 2 Thessalonians

Other semicontinuous treatments of New Testament books are as follows:

* 1 Corinthians:
  * Year A: chapters 1-3 for three Sundays in Epiphany and in February (the _RCL_ also includes 4.1-5 for 'Proper 3')
  * Year B: chapter 9 for two Sundays in February (the _RCL_ also features chapters 6-8 in Epiphany 2-4)
  * Year C: chapters 12-13 for two Sundays in Epiphany, followed by chapter 15 for three Sundays in February (the _RCL_ also includes 15.51-58 for 'Proper 3')
* 1 Peter: Easter season, Year A
* 1 John: Easter season, Year B
* Revelation: Easter season, Year C (also three Sundays in Epiphany, Year B, not sequential)

What about those parts of the Bible that are not read sequentially?

* Old Testament
  * Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Jonah, Micah, Zephaniah and Malachi: included, but not in a systematic way
  * Judges, Ruth, Ezra, Obadiah, Nahum and Haggai: not included
  * 1 and 2 Chronicles: not included (outside Festivals)
  * Ecclesiastes, Habakkuk and Zechariah: once as a 'Related' reading
  * Isaiah: features prominently in Advent, Christmas and Epiphany, and at other times (not sequential)
* New Testament
  * Titus: included, but not in a systematic way
  * 2 Peter: included, but not in a systematic way
  * 2 John, 3 John, Jude: not included

## Choosing between the readings {#choosing}

It is worth noting [rule 5][Lectionary Rules] at the top of the lectionary, which gives permission to extend the readings:

> In a compact cycle of readings such as these, some passages have necessarily been abbreviated. When opportunity allows, the passages may be read in full. Verses in brackets may be included or omitted, as desired.

Each service has the following readings:

* **Old Testament reading** (or sometimes a reading from Acts),
* **psalm or canticle** (usually a response to the first reading),
* **New Testament reading** (from an epistle or Revelation), and
* **Gospel reading**.

The psalm or canticle should normally be used, along with two or three of the other readings. When using just two of the other readings, [rule 6][Lectionary Rules] specifies:

> When there are only two readings at the principal service and that service is Holy Communion, the second reading is always the Gospel reading. ...
>
> When the Principal Service Lectionary is used at a service other than Holy Communion, the Gospel reading need not always be chosen.

In addition, on Sundays between Easter Day and Pentecost (and on Ascension Day, and on certain Festivals), the reading from Acts must be included.

Note that in _Common Worship_ Holy Communion (Order One or Two), 'Either one or two readings from Scripture precede the Gospel reading', and 'The psalm or canticle follows the first reading'. As the psalm or canticle is usually related to the Old Testament reading, this makes a lot of sense when that reading is used; it makes less sense when the Old Testament reading is omitted, because the psalm or canticle is often unrelated to the New Testament reading.

On the Sundays after Trinity, the Gospel reading and the New Testament reading follow separate tracks, and there are two alternative tracks for the Old Testament reading and the psalm, as explained in [rule 10][Lectionary Rules]:

> Those under the heading 'Continuous' allow the Old Testament reading and its complementary psalm to stand independently of the other readings. Those under the heading 'Related' relate the Old Testament reading and the psalm to the Gospel reading.

Those who prefer the readings to cohere can have their wishes partially satisfied by opting for the 'Related' Old Testament reading (and psalm), which is related to the Gospel reading. But the cost of this is that it prevents the Old Testament from speaking so clearly with its own voice. Also, there is no 'Related' alternative reading from the New Testament. (the _RCL_ provides these two tracks until the Sunday before Advent, whereas _Common Worship_ provides only the 'Related' track for the four Sundays before Advent, with some modifications.)

## Introductory Notes

Psalm references are to the [_Common Worship_ psalter](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/common-material/psalter). Where the versification is different in standard English versions of the Bible, this is indicated by 'EV'. Quotations are drawn from the Common Worship psalter or the [NRSV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-Anglicised-NRSVA-Bible/).

Depending on the day of the week for Christmas and the Epiphany, and the date of Easter, lectionary provision for days marked with * might not be used in any given year. Other days might also be displaced for various reasons.

Readings that are the same as (or overlap with) the 'Epistles and Gospels' printed in the Book of Common Prayer are marked with '(see _BCP_)', while those that are the same as (or overlap with) the supplementary readings in ['A Lectionary and Additional Collects for Holy Communion (Book of Common Prayer)'](https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/Lectionary.pdf) (linked from the [_Common Worship_ Lectionary page][Lectionary]) are marked with '(see _BCP+_)'.

# Advent

The readings are more strongly related to the themes of Advent than they are to each other within each Sunday.

There is a tradition in some parts of the church of reflecting on the themes of hope, peace, joy and love on the four Sundays of Advent. The theme of hope is present on the first three Sundays, while the theme of peace is discernable on Advent 2, and joy on Advent 3.

## Advent 1

The Gospel readings all speak of the 'coming' of 'the Son of Man'.

Year A

* **Isaiah 2.1-5** begins a 'series' in Isaiah, which covers all Sundays until Proper 1, except for Christmas 2 and Epiphany 4. God's people are urged to 'walk in the light of the Lord', looking ahead to 'days to come' when the nations stream to God's house in Zion in order to walk in God's paths and find peace with each other. **Psalm 122** has people going up to 'the house of the Lord' and speaks of 'peace'.
* **Romans 13.11-14** (see _BCP_) is an exhortation to 'lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light' because 'the day is near'.
* **Matthew 24.36-44** urges us to 'be ready' for 'the coming of the Son of Man'.

Year B

* **Isaiah 64.1-9** begins a four-part 'series' in Isaiah 40-64 (Advent 1-3 and Christmas 1), and begins, 'O that you would tear open the heavens and come down'.
* **Psalm 80.1-8, 18-20** (EV: 1-7, 17-19) [or 80.1-8 (EV: 1-7)] calls on God to 'come to our salvation' and 'show the light of your countenance', and speaks of 'the man at your right hand, the son of man you made so strong for yourself'.
* **1 Corinthians 1.3-9** speaks of waiting 'for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ' and 'the day of our Lord Jesus Christ'.
* **Mark 13.24-37** speaks of 'the Son of Man coming in clouds' and about 'that day or hour' being unknown: 'Keep awake.'

Year C

* **Jeremiah 33.14-16** speaks of God fulfilling his promise, and causing 'a righteous Branch to spring up for David'.
* **Psalm 25.1-9** (EV: 1-10) (see _BCP+_) calls on God to act: 'Remember, Lord, your compassion and love'.
* **1 Thessalonians 3.9-13** has Paul speaking of the Thessalonians being 'blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints'.
* **Luke 21.25-36** says, 'Then they will see "the Son of Man coming in a cloud" with power and great glory.'

## Advent 2

The Gospel readings all introduce John the Baptist.

Peace is a recurring theme.

Year A

* **Isaiah 11.1-10** continues in Isaiah, and speaks one who will come with the 'spirit of the Lord' and bring peace.
* **Psalm 72.1-7, 18-19** [or 72.1-7] speaks of the 'king' bringing 'justice' and 'peace': 'May he come down...'.
* **Romans 15.4-13** (see _BCP_) quotes Isaiah 11.10 ('The root of Jesse shall come, the one who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope': see Septuagint), speaks of living in harmony, and says, 'May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope'.
* **Matthew 3.1-12** introduces John the Baptist baptizing with water for repentance and pointing towards one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.

Year B

* **Isaiah 40.1-11** continues in Isaiah, speaks words of comfort to God's people, is quoted in the Gospel reading: 'prepare the way', and looks to the coming of the Lord. **Psalm 85.1-2, 8-13** [or 85.8-13] says of God: 'he shall speak peace to his people ... that they turn not again to folly'.
* **2 Peter 3.8-15a** says, 'the day of the Lord will come like a thief', and calls for repentance and peace: 'lives of holiness and godliness ... strive to be found by him at peace, without spot or blemish'.
* **Mark 1.1-8** quotes Isaiah 40.3 ('Prepare the way'), and is about John the Baptist 'proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins' in order to prepare the way for Jesus.

Year C

* **Philippians 1.3-11** looks ahead to 'the day of Jesus Christ'.
* **Luke 3.1-6** says, 'the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness', and quotes Isaiah: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low'. **Baruch 5.1-9** (from the Apocrypha) proclaims good news to Jerusalem, and echoes Isaiah, as quoted in the Gospel reading: 'For God has ordered that every high mountain and the everlasting hills be made low and the valleys filled up, to make level ground'. Alternatively, **Malachi 3.1-4** also echoes Isaiah, as quoted in the Gospel reading: 'See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me'. The canticle is the **Benedictus (Luke 1.68-79)**, the song of Zechariah, who says to John, 'you will go before the Lord to prepare his way' (_Common Worship_).

## Advent 3

The Gospel readings all continue with John the Baptist.

Joy is a recurring theme, echoing this Sunday being celebrated widely in Western Christianity as 'Gaudete Sunday', from _Gaudete_, 'Rejoice', in Philippians 4.4.

Year A

Four themes are present in the readings: the coming of the Lord, preparing the way, blind eyes being opened, and rejoicing.

* **Isaiah 35.1-10** (see _BCP+_) continues in Isaiah, and is a call to 'rejoice with joy' in the light of God coming, reversing fortunes, strengthening the weak, opening the eyes of the blind, and a 'highway' being there.
* **Psalm 146.4-10** (EV: 5-10) connects hope with joy ('Happy are those ... whose hope is in the Lord their God'), and says, 'the Lord opens the eyes of the blind'.
* Alternatively, the canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, which is a song of joy, and is about fortunes being reversed.
* **James 5.7-10** says, 'Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.'
* **Matthew 11.2-11** (see _BCP_) has Jesus sending a message to John the Baptist about blind eyes being opened, and speaking about John the Baptist preparing the way.

Year B

Three themes are present in the readings: the coming of the Lord, anointing, and joy.

* **Isaiah 61.1-4, 8-11** continues in Isaiah, and says, 'The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me', to give 'the oil of gladness', and calling for a response of joy: 'I will greatly rejoice in the Lord'.
* **Psalm 126** is a psalm of joy: 'The Lord has indeed done great things for us, and therefore we rejoiced', and looks ahead to a future restoration of fortunes.
* Alternatively, the canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, which is a song of joy: 'my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour'.
* **1 Thessalonians 5.16-24** could be seen as concluding the series in 1 Thessalonians from the end of Year A, and says 'Rejoice always', looking ahead to 'the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ'.
* **John 1.6-8, 19-28** is about the testimony of John concerning Jesus the Messiah (anointed one).

Year C

Joy is the theme of all the readings except for the Gospel reading.

* **Zephaniah 3.14-20** says, 'Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem', because God is 'in your midst', and speaks of 'that day'.
* The canticle, **Isaiah 12.2-6**, says, 'On that day you will say, "... Shout aloud and sing for joy, you that dwell in Zion, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel"' ([_Common Worship_](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/daily-prayer/canticles-daily-17)).
* Alternatively, **Psalm 146.4-10** (EV: 5-10) says, 'Happy are those who have the God of Jacob for their help'.
* **Philippians 4.4-7** says, 'Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. ... The Lord is near.'
* **Luke 3.7-18** has John calling for repentance, and saying that 'one who is more powerful than I is coming'.

## Advent 4

The Gospel readings all look towards Jesus' birth to Mary.

Year A

* **Isaiah 7.10-16** continues in Isaiah, and looks ahead to a young woman bearing a son and calling him Immanuel.
* **Psalm 80.1-8, 18-20** (EV: 1-7, 17-19) [or 80.1-8 (EV: 1-7)] calls on God to 'come to our salvation' and 'show the light of your countenance', and speaks of 'the man at your right hand, the son of man you made so strong for yourself'. 
* **Romans 1.1-7** says that Jesus 'was descended from David according to the flesh'.
* **Matthew 1.18-25** leads up to the birth of Jesus to Mary, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about 'Emmanuel'.

Year B

The readings reflect the theme of God's promises being fulfilled.

* **2 Samuel 7.1-11, 16** is God's promise to David: 'Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before me; your throne shall be established for ever.'
* The canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, the song of Mary: 'He has come to the aid of his servant Israel, to remember his promise of mercy'.
* Alternatively, **Psalm 89.1-4, 19-26** [or 89.1-8] speaks of God's promise to David: 'Your seed will I establish for ever and build up your throne for all generations.'
* **Luke 1.26-38** is the annunciation to Mary, 'engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David', and says of Jesus, that 'the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David'. Mary's response is, 'let it be with me according to your word'. **Romans 16.25-27** speaks about 'the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages ... to bring about the obedience of faith', reflecting Mary's response of obedient faith.

Year C

* **Micah 5.2-5a** (see _BCP+_ Christmas Eve) foretells a ruler coming from Bethlehem, from 'one of the little clans of Judah', and speaks of 'the time when she who is in labour has brought forth'.
* The canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, the song of Mary: 'He has ... lifted up the lowly'.
* Alternatively, **Psalm 80.1-8** (EV: 1-7) expresses the people's lowly condition ('our enemies laugh us to scorn'), and calls on God to 'come to our salvation'.
* **Hebrews 10.5-10** speaks of the incarnation: 'when Christ came into the world, he said, "... a body you have prepared for me"'.
* **Luke 1.39-45 [46-55]** has Mary visiting Elizabeth after the annunciation. At Mary's greeting, the child in Elizabeth's womb (John the Baptist) leaps for joy [and Mary responds with the Magnificat].

# Christmas

## Christmas Day

'Set III should be used at some service during the celebration.'

Set I (emphasis on the salvation Jesus brings)

* **Isaiah 9.2-7** (see _BCP+_) speaks of those in darkness seeing 'a great light', and announces that 'a child has been born', who will be named 'Wonderful Counsellor...', and who will reign 'with justice and with righteousness'.
* **Psalm 96** calls for rejoicing before the Lord, because 'he comes, he comes to judge the earth', 'with righteousness'.
* **Titus 2.11-14** says that 'the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all' through Jesus, who 'gave himself for us'.
* **Luke 2.1-14 [15-20]** (see _BCP+_ Christmas Eve) is about Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, the angels appearing to the shepherds and announcing the birth of a Saviour, [and the shepherds going to Bethlehem to 'see'].

Set II (emphasis on God's glory appearing and being seen)

* **Isaiah 62.6-12** begins by speaking of king and nations who will 'see ... your glory', and says to Zion, 'See, your salvation comes'.
* **Psalm 97** says of the Lord that 'all the peoples have seen his glory'.
* **Titus 3.4-7** (see _BCP+_ Christmas Eve) speaks of 'when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Saviour appeared'.
* **Luke 2.[1-7] 8-20** (see _BCP+_ Christmas Eve) is about [Jesus' birth in Bethlehem], the angels appearing to the shepherds and announcing the birth of a Saviour, and the shepherds going to Bethlehem to 'see'.

Set III (emphasis on Jesus' divinity)

* **Isaiah 52.7-10** speaks of 'the return of the Lord to Zion', and says that he 'has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations'.
* **Psalm 98** (see _BCP+_) speaks of the Lord bring victory by his 'own right hand and his holy arm', and calls for rejoicing before the Lord, because 'he comes to judge the earth'.
* **Hebrews 1.1-4 [5-12]** (see _BCP_) speaks of the 'Son' through whom God 'created the worlds', who is 'the exact imprint of God's very being', and who is 'superior to angels'. [When God 'brings the firstborn into the world', the angels worship him.]
* **John 1.1-14** (see _BCP_) speaks of the 'Word' who 'was God', through whom 'all things came into being', and who 'became flesh'.

## Christmas 1

These readings are used on the first Sunday _after_ Christmas.

The psalm is the same for Years A, B and C.

* **Psalm 148** [or 148.7-14] calls on the whole earth to praise the Lord, because he has 'raised up the horn of his people'.

Year A

The focus is on the Holy Innocents, celebrated on 28 December, which may coincide with Christmas 1.

* **Matthew 2.13-23** is part of the infancy narrative in Matthew, and describes Jesus being taken to Egypt to flee from Herod; the Massacre of the Innocents, and the returning of the Holy Family from Egypt. It therefore glimpses the suffering and exaltation of Jesus, which is reflected in the other readings. **Isaiah 63.7-9** continues in Isaiah, and reflects the Massacre of the Innocents: 'Surely they are my people, children who will not deal falsely ... in his love ... he lifted them up'. **Hebrews 2.10-18** is about God 'bringing many children to glory' through the incarnation and suffering of Jesus.

Year B

The focus is on the naming and circumcision of Jesus, celebrated on 1 January, which may coincide with Christmas 1.

* **Luke 2.15-21** begins with the response of the shepherds, and concludes with the naming and circumcision of Jesus. **Isaiah 61.10 &ndash; 62.3** reflects the theme of naming: 'you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow'. **Galatians 4.4-7** (see _BCP_) says that Jesus was 'born under the law', which explains why he was circumcised.

Year C

* **Luke 2.41-52** is about the child Jesus in the temple, concluding with: 'And Jesus increased in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favour.' **1 Samuel 2.18-20, 26** is about the child Samuel at 'the house of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>' (1.24), concluding with: 'Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favour with the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> and with the people.' **Psalm 148** [or 148.7-14] says (in addition to the note above), 'Young men and women, old and young together; let them praise the name of the Lord.' **Colossians 3.12-17** is about growing in virtue and wisdom: 'Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; teach and admonish one another in all wisdom'.

## Christmas 2*

These readings are used on the second Sunday _after_ Christmas, if there is one before the Epiphany. In other words, these readings apply only when there is a Sunday between 2 and 5 January, and when the Epiphany is not being celebrated on that day.

Years A, B and C

* **Jeremiah 31.7-14** has God showing grace to his people: 'I will comfort them'.
* Alternatively, **Ecclesiasticus 24.1-12** (from the Apocrypha) speaks of 'Wisdom', who 'came from the mouth of the Most High' (like the Word), and who was told by the Creator: 'Make your dwelling in Jacob' (like the Word becoming flesh).
* **Psalm 147.13-21** (EV: 12-20) praises God because he 'sends forth his command to the earth' and 'sends forth his word' (like the Word becoming flesh).
* Alternatively (as a canticle to follow the reading from Ecclesiasticus), **Wisdom of Solomon 10.15-21** (from the Apocrypha) is about wisdom.
* **Ephesians 1.3-14** praises God for 'his glorious grace' and speaks of God's plan 'to gather up all things in [Christ], things in heaven and things on earth' (as heaven and earth are brought together in the incarnation).
* **John 1.[1-9] 10-18** (see _BCP_) says that 'the Word became flesh', and that 'From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.'

# Epiphany

Although the Sundays are the Sundays _of_ Epiphany, if the Epiphany falls on a Sunday, the readings are moved to the following week. In other words, the readings for Epiphany N are used on the Nth Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (as in the _RCL_).

Note that the _RCL_ considers the 'Season of Epiphany' to be part of 'Ordinary Time', and to cover the whole period between the Epiphany and Lent.

## The Epiphany

May be celebrated on the Sunday between 2 and 8 January (the second Sunday _after_ Christmas).

Years A, B and C

* **Matthew 2.1-12** (see _BCP_) recounts the visit of 'wise men from the East' to the child Jesus in Bethlehem. **Isaiah 60.1-6** (see _BCP+_) says that 'Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn', adding that 'They shall bring gold and frankincense'. **Psalm 72.[1-9] 10-15** speaks of kings bringing gifts (including gold) to 'the king'. **Ephesians 3.1-12** (see _BCP_) is about the Gentiles becoming 'fellow-heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel'.

## The Baptism of Christ: Epiphany 1 {#epiphany-1}

These readings are used on the first Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (the Sunday between 7 and 13 January).

Celebrated on Monday 8 or 9 January if the Epiphany is celebrated on Sunday 7 or 8 January.

The psalm is the same for Years A, B and C.

* **Psalm 29** is about the 'voice of the Lord', including: 'The voice of the Lord is upon the waters'.

Year A

* **Matthew 3.13-17** is Matthew's account of the baptism of Jesus, with 'the Spirit of God' descending on him, and 'a voice from heaven' saying, 'This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.' **Isaiah 42.1-9** continues in Isaiah, is echoed in the Gospel reading: 'Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights'. **Acts 10.34-43** speaks of 'how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit' (as Peter shares the gospel with a Gentile, reflecting the Epiphany season).

Year B

* **Mark 1.4-11** describes John the Baptist's ministry of baptism ('I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit'), and has Jesus being baptised by John, with 'the Spirit' descending on him, and 'a voice ... from heaven'. **Genesis 1.1-5** says, 'a wind from God [or 'the spirit of God'] swept over the face of the waters. Then God said ...'. **Acts 19.1-7** has Paul in Ephesus contrasting the baptism of John with baptism 'in the name of the Lord Jesus', which is accompanied by the Holy Spirit.

Year C

* **Luke 3.15-17, 21-22** contrasts John's baptism ('with water') with that of Jesus ('with the Holy Spirit and fire'), and has Jesus being baptised, with the Holy Spirit descending upon him, and a voice from heaven. **Isaiah 43.1-7** says, 'I have called you by name, you are mine', and, 'When you pass through the waters, I will be with you'. **Acts 8.14-17** is about the believers in Samaria receiving the Holy Spirit, because they had 'only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus'.

## Epiphany 2

These readings are used on the second Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (the Sunday between 14 and 20 January).

The Gospel readings for this Sunday cover John 1.29 &ndash; 2.11. In the _RCL_, it makes sense to see these readings as John's announcement of the beginning of Jesus' public ministry (with echoes of Jesus' baptism), to go alongside next week's readings from Matthew, Mark and Luke. This makes slightly less sense under _Common Worship_: see note on Epiphany 3.

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 1.1-9** begins a six-part series covering almost all of 1 Corinthians 1-3. Paul gives thanks for the grace of God that has been given to the church in Corinth.
* **John 1.29-42** has John (the Baptist) saying of Jesus, 'Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world', reflecting the Epiphany season, adding that 'he was before me'. **Isaiah 49.1-7** continues in Isaiah, and has the 'servant' saying, 'The Lord called me before I was born', and the Lord saying to his servant, 'I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth'. **Psalm 40.1-12** (EV: 1-11) has the speaker saying, 'Lo, I come. In the scroll of the book it is written of me that I should do your will, O my God'.

Year B

* **Revelation 5.1-10** begins a three-part non-sequential series about the revelation of Jesus' glory in Revelation (replacing the _RCL_ readings: 1 Corinthians 6.12-20; 7.29-31; 8.1-13), and is about the 'Lion' who is a 'Lamb', and who is 'worthy to take the scroll'.
* **John 1.43-51** has Jesus calling Philip and Nathanael, who asks, 'Where did you come to know me?' **1 Samuel 3.1-10 [11-20]** is about God calling Samuel (see Proper 4). **Psalm 139.1-5, 12-18** (EV: 1-6, 13-18) [or 139.1-9 (EV: 1-10)] says, 'O Lord, you have searched me out and known me'.

Year C

* **1 Corinthians 12.1-11** begins a six-part series in 1 Corinthians 12-15 (the _RCL_ also includes 15.51-58 for 'Proper 3'), and is about spiritual gifts: 'To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.'
* **John 2.1-11** (see _BCP_) is the account of Jesus turning water into wine, by which he 'revealed his glory' (an Epiphany theme). This account features in Years A, B and C, each time on a different Sunday of Epiphany. Here, the focus is on the wedding. **Isaiah 62.1-5** says, 'as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you'. **Psalm 36.5-10** rejoices in God's love.

## Epiphany 3

These readings are used on the third Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (the Sunday between 21 and 27 January).

In the _RCL_, it makes sense to see this Sunday as marking the beginning of the semicontinuous series in the respective Gospel, with the Gospel reading marking the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. _Common Worship_ has a different approach, which emphasises the Epiphany season, partly by including John 2.1-11 in Year A (Epiphany 4) and Year B (Epiphany 3), in addition to Year C (Epiphany 2), and partly by setting the Gospel reading for the Presentation as the Gospel reading for Epiphany 4 in Year C.

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 1.10-18** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (without a gap), and is about divisions in the church.
* **Matthew 4.12-23** is the beginning of Jesus' ministry, in 'Galilee of the Gentiles'. **Isaiah 9.1-4** continues in Isaiah, and is quoted in the Gospel reading, including: 'The people ... in darkness have seen a great light'. **Psalm 27.1, 4-12** (EV: 1, 4-9) [or 27.1-11 (EV: 1-9a)] says, 'The Lord is my light and my salvation'.

Year B

The _RCL_ has Mark 1.14-20 as the Gospel reading, with related readings from Jonah 3.1-5, 10 and Psalm 62.5-12, all of which are transferred to 3 before Advent in _Common Worship_.

* **Revelation 19.6-10** continues the series about the revelation of Jesus' glory in Revelation (replacing the _RCL_ reading), and is about 'the marriage supper of the Lamb' (providing a connection with the Gospel reading).
* **John 2.1-11** is the account of Jesus turning water into wine, by which he 'revealed his glory' (an Epiphany theme). This account features in Years A, B and C, each time on a different Sunday of Epiphany. Here, the focus is on the wine. **Genesis 14.17-20** is about King Melchizedek who brings wine and is honoured by Abram. **Psalm 128** says, 'Your wife will be like a fruitful vine'.

Year C

* **1 Corinthians 12.12-31a** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 12-15 (without a gap), and is about the body of Christ, its members, and their various gifts.
* **Luke 4.14-21** begins a semicontinuous series in Luke 4-23, which covers this Sunday, three Sundays in February, and all the Sundays after Trinity until the Sunday before Advent. Jesus begins his public ministry by reading from Isaiah in the synagogue. Verses 22-30 could be included (set in the _RCL_ for the following Sunday, see also Bible Sunday). **Nehemiah 8.1-3, 5-6, 8-10** has Ezra reading from 'the book of the law of Moses', and the Levites teaching the people. (The lists of names are omitted.) **Psalm 19** [or 19.1-6] rejoices in God's law (7-14). (The shorter version is a _Common Worship_ alteration to the _RCL_, and makes little sense.)

## Epiphany 4*

These readings are used on the fourth Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February).

Displaced if the Presentation falls (or is celebrated) on a Sunday.

Year A

The _RCL_ has Matthew 5.1-12 as the Gospel reading, with related readings from Micah 6.1-8 and Psalm 15. (NB: Matthew 5.1-12 is set for All Saints' Day.) Micah 6.1-8, however, is not included elsewhere.

* **1 Corinthians 1.18-31** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (overlapping by one verse), and is about 'the message of the cross' and 'Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'. (Also set for Tuesday of Holy Week.)
* **John 2.1-11** is the account of Jesus turning water into wine, by which he 'revealed his glory' (an Epiphany theme). This account features in Years A, B and C, each time on a different Sunday of Epiphany. Here, the focus is on God's provision. **1 Kings 17.8-16** is about Elijah's provision of meal and oil to a widow who was running out. **Psalm 36.5-10** is about God's provision: 'They shall be satisfied with the abundance of your house; they shall drink from the river of your delights. For with you is the well of life'.

Year B

* **Revelation 12.1-5a** concludes the series about the revelation of Jesus' glory in Revelation (replacing the _RCL_ reading), and is about the 'woman' and her 'son ... who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron'.
* **Mark 1.21-28** begins a semicontinuous series in Mark 1-13, which covers this Sunday, three Sundays in February, and all the Sundays after Trinity until 2 before Advent, apart from five weeks in John 6 in July and August. (The series begins more naturally in the _RCL_ with Mark 1.14-20 in Epiphany 3, but this is transferred to 3 before Advent in _Common Worship_.) Jesus heals a man with an unclean spirit, provoking amazement: 'A new teaching—with authority!' **Deuteronomy 18.15-20** is about the new 'prophet' like Moses who will speak God's words. **Psalm 111** praises God for his 'marvellous deeds'.

Year C

The _RCL_ has Luke 4.21-30 as the Gospel reading, which is replaced by Luke 2.22-40 (the Gospel reading for the Presentation), along with related readings from the Old Testament and the Psalms.

* **1 Corinthians 13.1-13** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 12-15 (skipping half a verse), and is about love.
* **Luke 2.22-40** is the Gospel reading for the Presentation: see below. **Ezekiel 43.27 &ndash; 44.4** speaks of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> entering the sanctuary, and says, 'the glory of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> filled the temple of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>'. **Psalm 48** speaks of 'Mount Zion' as 'the divine dwelling place', and says, 'We have waited on your loving-kindness, O God, in the midst of your temple.'

## The Presentation of Christ in the Temple (Candlemas) {#presentation}

May be celebrated on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February (the fourth Sunday _after_ the Epiphany).

Years A, B and C

* **Luke 2.22-40** (see _BCP_) is the account of the child Jesus being presented in the temple, and concludes by saying that 'The child grew and became strong'. **Malachi 3.1-5** (see _BCP+_) says that 'the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple', to 'purify'. **Psalm 24.[1-6] 7-10** calls for the 'gates' and 'doors' to be 'lifted up' so that the 'Lord', the 'King of glory', 'may come in' [and also speaks of the need for 'clean hands and pure hearts']. **Hebrews 2.14-18** speaks of Jesus sharing 'flesh and blood', and then doing the work of the (heavenly) temple, as 'a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people'.

# Ordinary Time

## Sunday between 4 and 10 February (Proper 1)* {#proper-1}

(_RCL_ 'Fifth Sunday after the Epiphany'.)

* **1 Corinthians 2.1-12 [13-16]** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (without a gap), and is about Christ crucified and the wisdom of God.
* **Matthew 5.13-20** begins/resumes a semicontinuous series in Matthew 5-25, which covers these three Sundays in February, and all the Sundays between Trinity and Advent. Jesus speaks about being salt and light ('let your light shine before others'), about not coming to abolish the law or the prophets but to fulfil, and about righteousness. **Isaiah 58.1-9a [9b-12]** says 'your light shall break forth like the dawn' and 'rise in the darkness'. **Psalm 112.1-9 [10]** speaks of those whose righteousness is clearly seen.

Year B

Year C

* **1 Corinthians 15.1-11** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 12-15 (skipping chapter 14), and is about the preaching of the resurrection. (NB: on Easter Day, verses 1-11 are read in Year B, and verses 19-26 in Year C.)

Jesus calls fishermen as his first disciples. **Isaiah 6.1-8 [9-13]** continues the theme of calling, with the calling of Isaiah, following the same pattern as Luke 5.1-11: epiphany, reaction ('unclean', 'sinful'), reassurance, commission.[^Proper1] Isaiah saw the Lord, 'high and lofty', in his heavenly temple, and **Psalm 138** refers to God as 'high' and speaks of his 'holy temple'.

## Sunday between 11 and 17 February (Proper 2)* {#proper-2}

Omitted most years (if Ash Wednesday falls between 4 and 27 February).

## Sunday between 18 and 24 February (Proper 3)* {#proper-3}

Included very rarely (when Ash Wednesday falls between 7 and 10 March, or between 6 and 10 March in a leap year). Only falls on the Sunday between 18 and 21 February (22 February in a leap year).

(_RCL_ 'Seventh Sunday after the Epiphany', 'Proper 2'.)

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 3.10-11, 16-23** concludes the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (continuing without a gap), and is about building the church on the foundation of Jesus Christ. (The omitted verses about 'the Day' could easily be included: 'the fire will test what sort of work each has done'.)
* **Matthew 5.38-48** continues the series in Matthew (without a gap), and is about loving one's enemies. **Leviticus 19.1-2, 9-18** says, 'you shall love your neighbour as yourself'. **Psalm 119.33-40** is the second of two weeks in Psalm 119, and is about keeping God's commandments (reflecting the broader theme of the Gospel reading).

(6.39-49 is the reading for the following week in the _RCL_, which is omitted in _Common Worship_: see discussion below. To fill in the gap, this week's reading could be extended to 6.42 'when opportunity allows'.) (NB: Luke 6.20-31 set for All Saints' Day.) **Genesis 45.3-11, 15** is about Joseph's love for his brothers, who had behaved like his enemies. **Psalm 37.1-11, 40-41** (EV: 1-11, 39-40) [or 37.1-7] calls us not to fret about evildoers.

## 2 before Lent* {#before-lent-2}

Omitted occasionally (if Ash Wednesday falls between 4 and 13 February). Falls between 4 and 29 February.

Creation theme. As Gordon Giles explains,

> the Church of England has replaced the _RCL_ provision for the Second Sunday before Lent with 'creation' texts.[^Giles]

Many of the readings are also found in the _ASB_ for the Ninth Sunday before Christmas (with its theme of 'The Creation'): these are indicated below.

The addition of this creation-themed week means that 'Proper 3' in the _RCL_ is not included (although the Gospel reading for Year A is almost the same). The Gospel readings from that week contain several famous sayings of Jesus: see the [Appendix](#appendixgospels) for Mark 2.13-22 and Luke 6.39-49.

Year A

* **Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.3** (cf. _ASB_) is about the creation of the heavens and the earth (and could be seen as beginning a series on Genesis that continues in the summer).
* **Psalm 136** [or 136.1-9, 23-26] is about God who 'made the heavens' (5-9) and 'gives food to all creatures' (25).
* **Romans 8.18-25** says that 'the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God'.
* **Matthew 6.25-34** continues the series in Matthew, and says, 'do not worry', and invites us to consider God's care for the birds and the 'grass of the field'. (Matthew 6.25-33 also set for Harvest Thanksgiving, Year B.)

Year B

The focus is on creation through God's wisdom and through God's Son (or 'the Word').

* **Proverbs 8.1, 22-31** is about wisdom's role in creation.
* **Psalm 104.26-37** (EV: 24-35) (cf. _ASB_) praises God for his creation: 'In wisdom you have made them all'.
* **Colossians 1.15-20** (cf. _ASB_) says of God's Son that 'all things have been created through him and for him'.
* **John 1.1-14** (cf. _ASB_) says of the 'Word' that 'All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being.'

Year C

The focus is on the place of water in God's creation.

* **Genesis 2.4b-9, 15-25** (cf. _ASB_) starts with water ('a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the ground'), and then is about the creation of the man, the garden in Eden, the animals, and the woman (omitting the names of the rivers).
* **Psalm 65** says, 'You visit the earth and water it'.
* **Revelation 4** (cf. _ASB_) is a vision of heaven (with 'a sea of glass'), and has the 'elders' praising God, 'for you created all things'.
* **Luke 8.22-25** jumps ahead in the series in Luke (between Proper 6 and 7), and has a 'gale' on the lake: Jesus 'rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they ceased, and there was a calm'.

## 1 before Lent* {#before-lent-1}

Omitted very occasionally (if Ash Wednesday falls between 4 and 6 February). Falls between 4 February and 7 March.

(_RCL_ 'Last Sunday after the Epiphany', or 'Transfiguration Sunday'.)

The Gospel readings are about Jesus' Transfiguration (which is also celebrated on 6 August).

Year A

* **Matthew 17.1-9** is Matthew's account of Jesus' Transfiguration, on a mountain, with Peter, James and John, with Moses and Elijah appearing, a cloud overshadowing them, and a voice saying, 'This is my Son'. **Exodus 24.12-18** (see _BCP+_, Transfiguration) is about Moses seeing the glory of the Lord on the mountain. **Psalm 2** has God saying, 'Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion', and, 'You are my Son'. Alternatively, **Psalm 99** (also set for Year C) says that God 'spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud', and calls people to 'worship him upon his holy hill'. **2 Peter 1.16-21** includes Peter's eyewitness account of the Transfiguration.

Year B

* **Mark 9.2-9** (see _BCP+_, Transfiguration) is Mark's account of Jesus' Transfiguration, on a 'high mountain', with Moses and Elijah appearing. **2 Kings 2.1-12** is about Elijah being taken up to heaven. **Psalm 50.1-6** says that God 'has spoken' and 'shines forth'. **2 Corinthians 4.3-6** speaks about 'the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ'.

Year C

* **Luke 9.28-36 [37-43a]** is Luke's account of Jesus' Transfiguration 'on the mountain' [and his coming down from the mountain]: 'they saw his glory'. **Exodus 34.29-35** is about Moses coming down from Mount Sinai: 'the skin of his face was shining', and Moses veiled his face. **Psalm 99**: see Year A. **2 Corinthians 3.12 &ndash; 4.2** is about Moses veiling his face, but 'all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord'.

# Lent

In terms of the Gospel readings for Lent 1-5, there is some structure to the readings, with all years building towards a climax in John 11 or 12. In Lent 1, the respective Gospel reading narrates Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. The readings from Lent 2-5 have the following themes:

* Year A looks at some encounters with Jesus in John's Gospel, related to baptism. (Lent originated as a period of preparation for baptism.) After John 3 in Lent 2, with its baptismal overtones, the remaining readings cover 'the three classic passages from John's Gospel used from the earliest times for the instruction of candidates for baptism: the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4), the healing of the man born blind (John 9), and the raising of Lazarus (John 11)'.[^Lent]
* Year B looks towards Jesus' death and resurrection (one week in Mark, followed by three weeks in John), and
* Year C, mostly in Luke, is less clearly structured, and is about Jesus setting out for Jerusalem (Lent 2), then about repentance (Lent 3) and Jesus welcoming sinners (Lent 4), before finishing in John with Jesus being anointed at Bethany.

## Ash Wednesday

Falls between 4 February and 10 March.

Years A, B and C

* **Joel 2.1-2, 12-17** (see _BCP+_) says, 'return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning'.
* Alternatively, **Isaiah 58.1-12** says, 'Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice ...'.
* **Psalm 51.1-18** (EV: 1-17) says, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God'.
* **2 Corinthians 5.20b &ndash; 6.10** says, 'we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God'.
* **Matthew 6.1-6, 16-21** (see _BCP_) is about 'your Father who sees in secret', in relation to almsgiving, prayer, fasting, and storing up treasures in heaven.
* Alternatively, **John 8.1-11** is about the woman caught in adultery: 'Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.'

## Lent 1

The Gospel readings are about Jesus' temptation in the wilderness.

Year A

* **Psalm 32** is about confession and forgiveness of sin.
* **Matthew 4.1-11** (see _BCP_) is about Jesus being tempted by the devil in the wilderness. **Genesis 2.15-17; 3.1-7** (see _BCP+_) is about Eve and Adam succumbing to the serpent's temptation in the garden. **Romans 5.12-19** compares Adam with Christ.

Year B

* **Psalm 25.1-9** (EV: 1-10) includes confession of sin and a desire to follow God's ways.
* **Mark 1.9-15** is about Jesus being tempted by Satan in the wilderness (12-13), with surrounding verses about Jesus' baptism (9-11) and his proclamation of the good news (14-15). **1 Peter 3.18-22** mentions Christ's proclamation, calling to mind God's patience in the time of Noah, and connects the flood with baptism. **Genesis 9.8-17** is about God's covenant with Noah, his descendants, and 'all flesh that is on the earth': 'never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth'.

Year C

* **Luke 4.1-13** is about Jesus being tempted by the devil in the wilderness, and quoting words from Deuteronomy in response. **Deuteronomy 26.1-11** looks ahead to the end of Israel's time in the wilderness, when they 'come into the land'. **Psalm 91.1-2, 9-16** [or 91.1-11] (see _BCP+_) is quoted (by the devil) in the Gospel reading: 'For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. They shall bear you in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone' (11-12). **Romans 10.8b-13** begins by quoting from Deuteronomy, and is about the 'word of faith' that brings salvation.

## Lent 2

The Old Testament reading each year is about God's promise to Abram. In the light of the fall (see last week), this could be intended as a reminder of God's gracious response to human sin.

Year A

* **Genesis 12.1-4a** is about God's call and promise to Abram, and the beginning of Abram's journey. **Psalm 121** gives assurance of God's protection on the journey. **Romans 4.1-5, 13-17** is about Abraham's faith in God's promise.
* **John 3.1-17** begins a series of baptism-related encounters with Jesus in John's Gospel, and is about Nicodemus's encounter with Jesus, with its discussion of being born 'of water and Spirit'.

Year B

* **Genesis 17.1-7, 15-16** is about God's covenant with Abraham and Sarah: 'I will make nations of you'. **Psalm 22.23-31** calls for praise from nations and future generations. **Romans 4.13-25** is about God's promise and Abraham's faith, and quotes Genesis 17: 'for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations"'.
* **Mark 8.31-38** begins a series looking towards the cross, has Jesus foretelling his death and resurrection, and calling his followers to 'take up their cross'.

Year C

* **Genesis 15.1-12, 17-18** has God leading Abram from fear ('Do not be afraid') to faith in God's promises for the future ('To your descendants I give this land'). (Verses 13-16 could be included 'when opportunity allows'.) **Psalm 27** says, 'whom then shall I fear?' **Philippians 3.17 &ndash; 4.1** is about living in the light of God's promises for the future, awaiting 'a Saviour' from heaven.
* **Luke 13.31-35** has Jesus, on the way to Jerusalem (22), saying that 'it is impossible for a prophet to be killed away from Jerusalem'.

## Lent 3

Year A

* **John 4.5-42** continues the baptism-related series in John, and is about the Samaritan woman's encounter with Jesus, including a discussion about 'living water' (i.e., the Spirit, 7.39), and about worshipping the Father 'in spirit and in truth'. **Exodus 17.1-7** is about Moses bringing water from the rock, in response to the people testing God at Massah and Meribah. **Psalm 95** recalls the time when the people tested God at Massah and Meribah. **Romans 5.1-11** says that 'God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit'.

Year B

* **Exodus 20.1-17** is the Ten Commandments, reflecting the Lenten theme of self-examination. **Psalm 19** [or 19.7-14] is about God's law, and longs for a blameless life.
* **1 Corinthians 1.18-25** looks towards the cross: 'the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God'.
* **John 2.13-22** continues the series looking towards the cross, has Jesus saying (of his body), 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.'

Year C

* **Luke 13.1-9** has Jesus warning the people of God's displeasure with them and calling them to repent: 'unless you repent, you will all perish'. **Isaiah 55.1-9** says, 'Seek the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> ... let the wicked forsake their way, ... let them return to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, that he may have mercy on them'. **Psalm 63.1-9** (EV: 1-8) says, 'eagerly I seek you'. **1 Corinthians 10.1-13** is a warning of God's displeasure with his people and a call to repentance.

## Lent 4

May be 'displaced' by Mothering Sunday.

Year A

* **John 9.1-41** continues the baptism-related series in John, and is about the blind man receiving sight by washing in water, after Jesus has said, 'I am the light of the world'. The Pharisees are 'blind' in that they cannot see who Jesus is. **1 Samuel 16.1-13** is about recognising the Lord's anointed (David). **Psalm 23** has a possible connection with the Old Testament reading ('you have anointed my head with oil'), but seems more likely to reflect the experience of the man born blind, who was led (to water) by Jesus. Note that John 9 leads directly into John 10, apparently inviting the conclusion that the man born blind is one of Jesus' sheep. **Ephesians 5.8-14** is about light and darkness.

Year B

* **John 3.14-21** continues the series looking towards the cross, and says, 'just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life'. The following verses discuss the different kinds of deeds done by those who do or do not believe: 'done in God' or 'evil'. **Numbers 21.4-9** is about Moses making a bronze serpent and putting it on a pole. **Psalm 107.1-3, 17-22** [or 107.1-9] is about God delivering and healing those are rebellious and go astray. **Ephesians 2.1-10** is about being 'dead through the trespasses and sins' and being saved by grace through faith (believing) &ndash; 'not the result of works', but 'for good works'.

Year C

* **Luke 15.1-3, 11b-32** has the Pharisees and scribes saying that Jesus 'welcomes sinners', and Jesus telling the parable of the two sons, one of whom (the 'Prodigal Son') returns from 'a distant country', acknowledges his sin, and finds reconciliation. **Joshua 5.9-12** has God saying, 'Today I have rolled away from you the disgrace of Egypt', and is about the end of the Israelites' time in the wilderness, as they eat 'the produce of the land', and as the manna ceases. **Psalm 32** says, 'I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord," and you forgave the guilt of my sin.' **2 Corinthians 5.16-21** is about reconciliation with God.

## Mothering Sunday

The readings are related to mothering, but with a tinge of pain and hints of the cross, appropriately for Lent.

Years A, B and C

* **Exodus 2.1-10** is about Moses' mother placing her baby into the water, only to receive him back again from Pharaoh's daughter.
* Alternatively, **1 Samuel 1.20-28** is about Samuel's mother giving him to the Lord.
* **Psalm 34.11-20** says, 'Come, my children, and listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.'
* Alternatively, **Psalm 127.1-4** (EV: 1-3) says, 'Children are a heritage from the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his gift.'
* **2 Corinthians 1.3-7** is about suffering and consolation (reflecting the experience of motherhood, perhaps).
* Alternatively, **Colossians 3.12-17** is about virtues such as compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, patience and love (relevant for motherhood, perhaps).
* **Luke 2.33-35** has Simeon saying to Mary, 'a sword will pierce your own soul too'.
* Alternatively, **John 19.25-27** has Jesus speaking to his mother from the cross.

## Lent 5

Year A

* **John 11.1-45** concludes the baptism-related series in John, and is about the dying and rising of Lazarus, which is related to baptism, and also looks ahead to Jesus' death and resurrection. **Ezekiel 37.1-14** is about God's breath (spirit) bringing dry bones to life. **Psalm 130** is about waiting for redemption: 'Out of the depths have I cried to you, O Lord'. **Romans 8.6-11** is about God giving life to mortal bodies through his Spirit.

Year B

* **Jeremiah 31.31-34** is the promise of a new covenant: 'I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts'. **Psalm 51.1-13** (EV: 1-12) says, 'you ... shall make me understand wisdom in the depths of my heart'. Alternatively, **Psalm 119.9-16** says, 'Your words have I hidden within my heart, that I should not sin against you.'
* **John 12.20-33** concludes the series looking towards the cross, and says that Jesus will be glorified through his death, in which he will be 'lifted up' (see John 3.14 from last week). **Hebrews 5.5-10** says that Jesus 'did not glorify himself', but suffered and then was 'designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek'.

Year C

* **Isaiah 43.16-21** has God saying, 'I am about to do a new thing ... I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.' **Psalm 126** says, 'Restore again our fortunes, O Lord, as the river beds of the desert.'
* **John 12.1-8** has Jesus in Bethany being anointed with 'costly perfume' by Mary. Judas complains that the perfume could have been sold, but Jesus says, 'She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial.' (This event is also recorded in Matthew and Mark, but not in Luke, although a similar event is described in Luke 7.36-50. Mark's account is included on Palm Sunday in Year B, but Matthew's account is not included in the lectionary.) **Philippians 3.4b-14** is about valuing things differently because of Christ: 'I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord'.

## Palm Sunday

The lectionary assumes a 'Liturgy of the Palms' and a 'Liturgy of the Passion', each with its own reading from the Gospels and the Psalms (as in [_Times and Seasons_](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/times-and-seasons-2#mmm151)). But this is not mandatory, and it is not clear what should be done if there is no 'Liturgy of the Palms'. Presumably that part could simply be omitted. But the [_RCL_](http://www.commontexts.org/rcl/download/) describes an alternative: 'Those who do not observe the procession with palms and do not wish to use the passion gospel may substitute the gospel and psalm given for the Liturgy of the Passion with the gospel and psalm indicated for the Liturgy of the Palms. Whenever possible, the whole passion narrative should be read.'

**Liturgy of the Palms**

Year A

* **Matthew 21.1-11** is Matthew's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (branches are mentioned, but no palms specifically).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-29** [or 118.19-24] is about entering (the city) with joy, and says, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord', which is echoed in all four Gospel accounts ('hosanna' comes from 'save' in the previous verse).

Year B

* **Mark 11.1-11** is Mark's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (branches are mentioned, but no palms specifically).
* Alternatively, **John 12.12-16** is John's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (and the only account to mention palm branches).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-24** [or 118.19-24] omits the verse about 'Blessed is he...' (see Year A), presumably for brevity (or possibly by mistake: see _RCL_), and therefore focuses on entering (the city) with joy.

Year C

* **Luke 19.28-40** is Luke's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (no palms or branches are mentioned).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-29** [or 118.19-24]: see Year A.

**Liturgy of the Passion**

* **Philippians 2.5-11** (see _BCP_) is about Christ, who 'humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death &ndash; even death on a cross'.

Year A

Year B

* **Mark 14.1 &ndash; 15.47** recounts Jesus' anointing, last supper, betrayal, trial, death and burial.

* Alternatively, **Luke 23.1-49** begins with Jesus' trial before Pilate and ends soon after Jesus' death.

## Monday of Holy Week

Years A, B and C

* **Isaiah 42.1-9** is the first of the four 'servant songs', and speaks of 'justice' and 'righteousness'. **Psalm 36.5-11** says, 'Your righteousness stands like the strong mountains, your justice like the great deep'.

# Easter

A reading from Acts is included every Sunday between Easter Day and Pentecost, and on Ascension Day, and it 'must be used as either the first or second reading', even if there are ['only two readings'][Lectionary Rules].

Gospel readings between Easter Day and Pentecost are exclusively from John's Gospel (continuing to Trinity Sunday in Years B and C), except on Easter 3 in Years A and B, on Ascension Day, and except for the alternative readings for Easter Day (which duplicate those for the Easter Vigil). Furthermore, on Easter 5, 6 and 7 (and on Pentecost in Years B and C, and Trinity in Year C), the readings are from the 'farewell discourse' (John 13-17).

## Easter Vigil

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the Gospel reading. 'A minimum of three Old Testament readings should be chosen. The reading from Exodus 14 should always be used.'

* **Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.4a** picks up on Easter and baptismal themes of (new) creation out of water, new life, and light out of darkness. **Psalm 136.1-9, 23-26** praises God as Creator.
* **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 4, spread over three weeks in Year A, Easter 4-6), picks up on the resurrection of Jesus being like passing through the waters of the flood. The dove points towards the gift of the Spirit at Pentecost. **Psalm 46** is about God as a refuge, 'Though the waters rage and swell'.
* **Genesis 22.1-18** (also the alternative _alternative_ first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) is about Abraham's beloved son Isaac being taken to the point of death and rescued. **Psalm 16** says, 'Preserve me, O God,' and 'you will not abandon my soul to Death'.
* **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 2) draws on the connection between Israel passing through the Red Sea and Jesus passing through death to new life. The canticle **Exodus 15.1b-13, 17-18** continues the theme.
* **Isaiah 55.1-11** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year B) picks up on baptismal themes: 'come to the waters', and 'as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth ...'. The canticle **Isaiah 12.2-6** says, 'With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.'
* **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 &ndash; 4.4** (from the Apocrypha, also the alternative first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) is about wisdom, perhaps picking up on the Easter theme of newness of life. (Alternatively, **Proverbs 8.1-8, 19-21; 9.4b-6** is also about wisdom.) **Psalm 19** says, 'the testimony of the Lord ... gives wisdom to the simple'.
* **Ezekiel 36.24-28** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 7) says to a people in exile, 'I will sprinkle clean water upon you,' and 'I will put my spirit within you'. **Psalms 42, 43** expresses longing for God.
* **Ezekiel 37.1-14** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year C, and Pentecost, Year B, and the Old Testament reading for Lent 5, Year A) is about God's breath (spirit) bringing dry bones to life. **Psalm 143** speaks about being made to 'sit in darkness like those long dead', and says, 'Revive me, O Lord'.
* **Zephaniah 3.14-20** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 3) rejoices in God's salvation, and in fortunes being restored. **Psalm 98** rejoices in God's salvation.
* **Romans 6.3-11** connects baptism with the death and resurrection of Jesus. **Psalm 114** connects this with Israel coming out of Egypt and crossing the Jordan.

Year A

* **Matthew 28.1-10** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Matthew's account of the discovery of the empty tomb, and the appearance of the risen Jesus to the women.

Year B

* **Mark 16.1-8** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Mark's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

Year C

* **Luke 24.1-12** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Luke's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

## Easter Day

Falls between 22 March and 25 April.

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the alternative first reading, the epistle, and the alternative Gospel reading.

* **Acts 10.34-43** begins a (vaguely sequential) series in Acts, and features Peter telling Cornelius about Jesus' life, death and resurrection.
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24** [or 118.14-24] draws on the same psalm as last week, and reflects the theme of resurrection: 'I shall not die, but live ... The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone'.
* **John 20.1-18** (see _BCP_) begins a series in John, and is John's account of the discovery of the empty tomb, and the appearance of the risen Jesus to Mary Magdalene.

Year A

* As an alternative first reading, **Jeremiah 31.1-6** is about the return from exile (a glimpse of resurrection).
* **Colossians 3.1-4** (see _BCP_) says, 'if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above'.
* For the alternative Gospel reading, **Matthew 28.1-10**, see Easter Vigil.

Year B

* As an alternative first reading, **Isaiah 25.6-9** says that God 'will swallow up death for ever'.
* **1 Corinthians 15.1-11** says that Christ 'was raised' and 'appeared'.
* For the alternative Gospel reading, **Mark 16.1-8**, see Easter Vigil.

Year C

* As an alternative first reading, **Isaiah 65.17-25** reflects the connection between resurrection and new creation.
* **1 Corinthians 15.19-26** is one of the portions of the chapter proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus (see also Year B, and the Year C Sundays in February).
* For the alternative Gospel reading, **Luke 24.1-12**, see Easter Vigil.

## Easter 2

The Gospel reading and alternative first reading are the same for Years A, B and C.

* For the alternative first reading, **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21**, see Easter Vigil.
* **John 20.19-31** (see _BCP_) continues (directly) the series in John, with Jesus' appearances on Easter evening and a week later.

Year A

* **Acts 2.14a, 22-32** continues the series in Acts (and begins a three-part series in Acts 2), and has Peter on the Day of Pentecost saying, 'This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.'
* **Psalm 16** is quoted in the reading from Acts: 'you will not abandon my soul to Death/Hades'.
* **1 Peter 1.3-9** begins a (mostly) semicontinuous series in 1 Peter (which covers all of the 'Easter N' Sundays), and has the same Peter speaking of the hope that comes through the resurrection of Jesus.

Year B

* **Acts 4.32-35** continues the series in Acts, and is about the believers sharing their possessions, as 'the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus'. **Psalm 133** says, 'How very good and pleasant it is when kindred live together in unity!'
* **1 John 1.1 &ndash; 2.2** begins a semicontinuous series in 1 John (which covers all of the 'Easter N' Sundays). Some parts of 1 John are quite negative and challenging, and the series appears to favour the more positive and accessible portions of the letter. (It is difficult to discern anything more subtle guiding the selection of passages.) This first passage is about 'fellowship ... with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ', and also 'fellowship with one another' (as in the reading from Acts). The testimony is about 'what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands' (as with Thomas in the reading from John).

Year C

* **Acts 5.27-32** continues the series in Acts, and recounts the apostles before the Sanhedrin, testifying to Jesus' resurrection (with a mention of the Holy Spirit).
* **Psalm 118.14-29** largely duplicates the psalm from last week (and the week before), and speaks of the 'stone which the builders rejected', linking with the rejection of Jesus by the authorities in Acts. An alternative psalm is provided, **Psalm 150**, which is a joyful expression of praise for God's mighty acts.
* **Revelation 1.4-8** begins a (sparse but sequential) series in Revelation (which covers all of the 'Easter N' Sundays), and speaks of Jesus Christ as 'the firstborn of the dead'.

## Easter 3

Years A and B interrupt the Easter series in John with an excursion into Luke 24.

The alternative first reading is the same for Years A, B and C.

* For the alternative first reading, **Zephaniah 3.14-20**, see Easter Vigil.

Year A

* **Acts 2.14a, 36-41** continues the series in Acts (and continues the three-part series in Acts 2), and recounts the response to Peter's address: repentance and baptism.
* **Psalm 116.1-3, 10-17** (EV: 1-4, 12-19) [or 116.1-7 (EV: 1-8)] is about deliverance from the 'snares of death'.
* **1 Peter 1.17-23** continues the series in 1 Peter, and speaks of living in 'reverent fear' and love, in the light of the resurrection and the new birth.
* **Luke 24.13-35** is the account of the risen Jesus appearing on the way to Emmaus.

Year B

* **Acts 3.12-19** continues the series in Acts, and explains (as in the following week) that the lame man was enabled to walk through faith in the name of Jesus, 'whom God raised from the dead', and calls for repentance. **Psalm 4** says, 'when I call upon the Lord, he will hear me'.
* **1 John 3.1-7** continues the series in 1 John, and speaks of being 'children of God' and being people who 'purify themselves' (repentance).
* **Luke 24.36b-48** has the risen Jesus opening the minds of his disciples 'to understand the scriptures', and saying, 'Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name' (with 'name' and repentance providing connections with the reading from Acts).

Year C

* **Acts 9.1-6 [7-20]** continues the series in Acts, and describes Jesus' activity after his resurrection and ascension in relation to Saul, bringing about a kind of death-to-life transformation.
* **Psalm 30** is a life-from-death psalm (perhaps reflecting Saul's experience).
* **Revelation 5.11-14** continues the series in Revelation, and gives glory to the slain-but-living Lamb.
* **John 21.1-19** concludes the post-resurrection sub-series in John (extending the readings beyond John 20, unlike Years A and B).

## Easter 4

The theme of Jesus as the shepherd dominates, with Gospel readings from John 10, and with Psalm 23 included every year. (This Sunday is sometimes known as 'Good Shepherd Sunday'.)

* **Psalm 23** continues the shepherd theme, and is grounded in the resurrection of Jesus, because of which we need not fear when we 'walk through the valley of the shadow of death'.

Year A

* **Acts 2.42-47** continues the series in Acts (and concludes the three-part series in Acts 2), and describes the shared life of the believers.
* The alternative first reading, **Genesis 7**, begins a series on the flood in Genesis, expanding the alternative reading for Years B and C. The resurrection of Jesus is like passing through the waters of the flood. See also Proper 4.
* **1 Peter 2.19-25** continues the series in 1 Peter (out of sequence, in order to include the description of Jesus as 'shepherd'), and is about suffering after Jesus' example.
* **John 10.1-10** continues the series in John, and introduces the theme of the sheep and the shepherd (although Jesus here is the gate). Jesus has come to give life to the sheep.

Year B

* **Acts 4.5-12** continues the series in Acts, and explains (as in the previous week) that the man was healed 'by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, ... whom God raised from the dead'. The focus is more on the 'rulers, elders, and scribes', who might be likened to the 'hired hand' in the reading from John.
* For the alternative first reading, **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13**, see Easter Vigil.
* **1 John 3.16-24** continues the series in 1 John, and says that Jesus 'laid down his life for us' (as in the reading from John) and that 'we ought to lay down our lives for one another'.
* **John 10.11-18** continues the series in John, and says that Jesus is the good shepherd who lays down his life (as in the reading from 1 John), and who takes it back up again.

Year C

* **Acts 9.36-43** continues the series in Acts, and shows that Jesus' power to raise the dead is active through his apostle Peter. The resurrection leads to the growth of the church.
* For the alternative first reading, **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13**, see Easter Vigil.
* **John 10.22-30** continues the series in John, and says that Jesus gives life to his sheep. **Revelation 7.9-17** continues the series in Revelation, and features the Lamb, whose blood has been shed, but who is alive, and is described as a shepherd.

## Easter 5

The Gospel reading begins a series on the 'farewell discourse', which continues on Sundays until Easter 7 (Year A), Pentecost (Years B) or Trinity (Year C).

Year A

* **Acts 7.55-60** continues the series in Acts, and describes Stephen's vision of the risen Jesus, before his martyrdom. **Psalm 31.1-5, 15-16** [or 31.1-5] says, 'Into your hands I commend my spirit', which is echoed by Stephen: 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.'

* **1 Peter 2.2-10** continues the series in 1 Peter, and describes Jesus as 'a living stone', and believers as 'living stones'.
* **John 14.1-14** continues the series in John, and begins a series on the 'farewell discourse' with a two-part series on John 14. Jesus says that he is going to the Father.

* For the alternative first reading, **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 &ndash; 4.4**, or **Genesis 22.1-18**, see Easter Vigil.
* **1 John 4.7-21** continues the series in 1 John, and says, 'God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them', providing connections with the reading from John.
* **John 15.1-8** continues the series in John, and begins a series on the 'farewell discourse' with a two-part series on John 15. Jesus is the true vine, and he calls the 'branches' to 'abide in me' (as in the reading from 1 John) and hence to 'bear much fruit'.

Year C

* **Acts 11.1-18** continues the series in Acts, recounting the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles. **Psalm 148** [or 148.1-6] invites 'all peoples' and all creation to 'Praise the Lord'.

As the Sunday before the Rogation Days (the weekdays before Ascension Day), this is often observed as 'Rogation Sunday', with a focus on asking for God's blessing on the crops. ('Rogation' comes from Latin _rogare_, to ask.)

Year A

* **Acts 17.22-31** continues the series in Acts, and features Paul's speech to the Areopagus. Paul speaks of God who 'gives to all mortals life and breath and all things' (Rogation), and concludes by speaking of the resurrection of Jesus.
* The alternative first reading, **Genesis 8.20 &ndash; 9.17**, concludes the series on the flood in Genesis.

* **John 14.15-21** continues the series in John's 'farewell discourse' (without a gap). Jesus will 'ask the Father' (Rogation) for the gift of 'another Advocate ... the Spirit of truth'.

Year B

* **Acts 10.44-48** continues the series in Acts (continuing the reading from Easter Day without a gap), and recounts 'the gift of the Holy Spirit' being 'poured out even on the Gentiles'. **Psalm 98** says, 'all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God'.
* For the alternative first reading, **Isaiah 55.1-11**, see Easter Vigil.

Year C

* **Acts 16.9-15** continues the series in Acts, recounting Lydia's conversion, as the risen Jesus opens her heart, and as the gospel advances into Europe.
* For the alternative first reading, **Ezekiel 37.1-14**, see Easter Vigil.
* **Psalm 67** picks up the Rogation theme, asking for a good harvest, but also calls for the nations to praise God, which links with the reading from Acts.
* **Revelation 21.10, 22 &ndash; 22.5** continues the series on Revelation, focusing on the Holy City.
* **John 14.23-29** continues the series in John's 'farewell discourse', looking ahead to the gift of the Spirit. (Verses 25-27 might be included in the Gospel reading for Pentecost.)
* The alternative, **John 5.1-9**, recounts the healing at the pool in Beth-zatha (Bethesda). Jesus tells the sick man to 'Stand up' ('Arise'), which makes this reading appropriate for the Easter season, but it is difficult to identify a connection with this particular Sunday.

## Ascension Day

Years A, B and C

* **Acts 1.1-11** (see _BCP_) recounts Jesus' ascension.
* The alternative first reading, **Daniel 7.9-14** (see _BCP+_), has the Son of Man approaching the Ancient of Days and being given authority.

* **1 Peter 4.12-14; 5.6-11** concludes the series in 1 Peter, and is about present suffering and future glory, which might resonate with the expectant longing of the period between Ascension Day and Pentecost.
* **John 17.1-11** continues the series in John, and concludes the series in the 'farewell discourse', with the first section of Jesus' prayer (see Years B and C). Jesus' prayer for his own glorification is answered in his ascension.

* **Psalm 104.26-36, 37b** (EV: 24-34, 35b) [or 104.26-37 (EV: 24-35)] includes 'When you send forth your spirit, they are created'.

Year A

* The alternative first reading, **Numbers 11.24-30**, has Moses saying, 'Would that all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit on them!'

* **John 14.8-17 [25-27]** (see _BCP_) continues the series John's 'farewell discourse', with Jesus' promise of the Spirit. (Verses 25-27 might have been included for Easter 6.)

# Ordinary Time

## Trinity Sunday

Falls between 17 May and 20 June.

Year A

(The _RCL_ has Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.4a as the first reading, which then serves as the beginning of a series in Genesis. See 2 before Lent, which includes this passage as the Old Testament reading.)

* **Isaiah 40.12-17, 27-31** says, 'Who has directed the spirit of the Lord ...?' Is the answer, 'Jesus'? Otherwise, the connection with Trinity Sunday is not immediately obvious.
* **Psalm 8** (Years A and C) (see _BCP+_) is about God's glory being revealed in creation and redemption (this finds its climax when God is revealed as Trinity), and is about God's 'name' (cf. Matthew 28.19: 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit').
* **2 Corinthians 13.11-13** refers to the Trinity: 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.'

* **John 16.12-15** concludes the series in John (and the series in the 'farewell discourse'), and speaks of the Trinity, with Jesus speaking about the Spirit and about the Father.

(See also the alternative first readings for Easter 4-6.) **Psalm 46** says, 'Therefore we will not fear, though ... the waters rage and swell'.

* **Matthew 7.21-29** continues the series in Matthew (from 2 before Lent), on the theme of hearing and doing, with the house on rock or sand, and the floods coming.

The 'Related' reading, **Deuteronomy 11.18-21, 26-28**, is about blessing following obedience, and curse following disobedience.

The series has between zero and four weeks on Elijah (depending on the date of Easter, and out of sequence), followed by two weeks each for Elisha (the first of which is the transition from Elijah), Amos, Hosea and Isaiah, nine weeks in Jeremiah and Lamentations, and a final week in Joel. This reading begins the Elijah/Elisha series in 1 and 2 Kings, with Elijah on Mount Carmel. **Psalm 96** contrasts the Lord with idols.

(The gap in the reading could be filled to include material that is otherwise omitted from the lectionary.)

(_RCL_ 'Proper 26'.)

Displaced if All Saints' Day falls (or is celebrated) on a Sunday.

Year A

* The alternative psalm, **Psalm 107.1-8**, is derived from the _RCL_, which has a 'Continuous' Old Testament reading from Joshua 3.7-17, about the crossing of the Jordan, followed by Psalm 107.1-7, 33-37, which says, 'The Lord turns rivers into wilderness' (33).
* **1 Thessalonians 2.9-13** continues the series in 1 Thessalonians (without a gap), and is about how both Paul and the word of God worked among the believers.
* **Matthew 24.1-14** continues the series in Matthew, and is about 'the sign of [Jesus'] coming and of the end of the age'. (The _RCL_ has Matthew 23.1-12, which fits less well with the themes of the Sundays before Advent, but the change leaves a gap in the lectionary provision.) **Micah 3.5-12** is the related reading for the _RCL_ reading, Matthew 23.1-12, pronouncing judgment on the prophets and rulers, but it also fits with Matthew 24.1-14, declaring that 'Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins'. **Psalm 43** calls out for deliverance 'from the deceitful and the wicked'.

Year B

* **Hebrews 9.11-14** continues the series on Christ as high priest in Hebrews 1-10, and contrasts the sacrifices of the earthly tabernacle with the sacrifice of Christ (see next week), focusing on the power of Christ's blood to sanctify and purify.
* **Mark 12.28-34** continues the series in Mark, and is about the greatest commandments. **Deuteronomy 6.1-9** is quoted in the Gospel reading: 'Hear, O Israel ...'. **Psalm 119.1-8** says, 'You, O Lord, have charged that we should diligently keep your commandments.'

Year C

* **2 Thessalonians 1.1-12** begins a three-week series in 2 Thessalonians. Paul looks ahead to the coming of Jesus.
* **Luke 19.1-10** continues the series in Luke, with Zacchaeus the repentant and forgiven tax-collector. **Isaiah 1.10-18** is a call to repentance and to seek justice, with a promise of forgiveness. **Psalm 32.1-8** (EV: 1-7) is about repentance and forgiveness.

## 3 before Advent (between 6 and 12 November) {#before-advent-3}

(_RCL_ 'Proper 27'.)

Usually Remembrance Sunday (the Sunday between 8 and 14 November).

Year A

* **1 Thessalonians 4.13-18** continues the series in 1 Thessalonians, and is about 'the coming of the Lord'.
* **Matthew 25.1-13** continues the series in Matthew, and is the parable of the ten bridesmaids (five foolish and five wise). **Wisdom of Solomon 6.12-16** (from the Apocrypha) is about wisdom, and is continued in the canticle, **Wisdom of Solomon 6.17-20**. Alternatively, **Amos 5.18-24**, is a warning (to the foolish) that 'the day of the Lord' will be 'darkness, not light', whereas **Psalm 70** echoes the longing of the wise bridesmaids for the coming of the bridegroom: 'O Lord, do not delay'.

Year B

The Gospel and related Old Testament and Psalm are transferred from _RCL_ Epiphany 3, conceivably because they were considered more suitable to Remembrance Sunday and the Sundays before Advent than the _RCL_ readings (Mark 12.38-44 and related passages about poor widows).

* **Hebrews 9.24-28** continues the series on Christ as high priest in Hebrews 1-10, and continues to contrast the sacrifices of the earthly tabernacle with the sacrifice of Christ (see last week), focusing on the 'once for all' nature of Christ's sacrifice, preparing the way for Christ to 'appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him'.
* **Mark 1.14-20** continues the series in Mark (out of sequence), and is about Jesus proclaiming, 'repent, and believe the good news' (because 'the kingdom of God has come near'), and calling people to follow him. **Jonah 3.1-5, 10** is about the people of Nineveh believing (trust) God and repenting at the preaching of Jonah: 'they turned from their evil ways'. **Psalm 62.5-12** is about trusting God, and reflects God's response to the repentance of the people of Nineveh: 'Steadfast love belongs to you, O Lord, for you repay everyone according to their deeds.'

Year C

* **2 Thessalonians 2.1-5, 13-17** continues the series in 2 Thessalonians, with more on the coming of Jesus.
* **Luke 20.27-38** continues the series in Luke, and picks up the end-times emphasis of the Sundays before Advent, with Jesus and the Sadducees discussing the resurrection and marriage. **Job 19.23-27a** contains a glimpse of resurrection hope. **Psalm 17.1-9** [or 17.1-8] follows Job in pleading integrity before God.

## 2 before Advent (between 13 and 19 November) {#before-advent-2}

Sometimes Remembrance Sunday (the Sunday between 8 and 14 November).

Year A

* **1 Thessalonians 5.1-11** concludes the series in 1 Thessalonians (continuing without a gap), and is about 'the day of the Lord'. (The series could be concluded a few weeks later, in Advent 3, Year A, with 1 Thessalonians 5.16-24.)
* **Matthew 25.14-30** continues the series in Matthew (without a gap), and is the parable of the talents, concluding with a warning of judgment. **Zephaniah 1.7, 12-18** is about the day of the Lord: 'Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them'. **Psalm 90.1-8 [9-11] 12** [or 90.1-8] says, 'You have set our misdeeds before you and our secret sins in the light of your countenance.'

Year B

* **Hebrews 10.11-14 [15-18] 19-25** concludes the series on Christ as high priest in Hebrews 1-10, and focuses on our response: 'let us approach ... Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering ... And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds'. (The series could be concluded a few weeks later, in Advent 4, Year C, with the preceding passage, Hebrews 10.5-10.)
* **Mark 13.1-8** continues the series in Mark, and has Jesus warning of 'wars and rumours of wars', as 'the beginning of the birth pangs', before 'the end'. **Daniel 12.1-3** speaks of 'a time of anguish' and of the dead being raised. **Psalm 16** expresses confidence in the face of death: 'my flesh also shall rest secure. For you will not abandon my soul to Death'.

Year C

* **2 Thessalonians 3.6-13** concludes the series in 2 Thessalonians, with a warning against idleness.
* **Luke 21.5-19** continues the series in Luke, and continues the end-times emphasis of the Sundays before Advent, with Jesus speaking about the destruction of the temple and the signs of the end times. **Malachi 4.1-2a** looks ahead to a day of destruction. **Psalm 98** says that the Lord 'comes to judge the earth'.

## Christ the King: 1 before Advent (between 20 and 26 November) {#before-advent-1}

Year B

* **Daniel 7.9-10, 13-14** has 'one like a human being coming with the clouds of heaven', being presented before 'the Ancient One': 'his kingship is one that shall never be destroyed'.
* **Psalm 93** begins, 'The Lord is king'.
* **Revelation 1.4b-8** speaks of Jesus as 'the ruler of the kings of the earth', and quotes the reading from Daniel: 'He is coming with the clouds'.
* **John 18.33-37** has Jesus speaking to Pilate about his 'kingdom'.

Year C

* **Jeremiah 23.1-6** (see _BCP_) says that God will raise up 'a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king'.
* **Psalm 46** has God reigning over the nations, causing wars to cease.

# Festivals

The _RCL_ provides readings only for a small number of the Festivals listed below: the Annunciation, the Visitation, Holy Cross, and Thanksgiving Day (observed in _Common Worship_ as Harvest Thanksgiving).

According to the [Rules], Festivals are 'not usually displaced'. However,

> Festivals falling on a Sunday are to be kept on that day or transferred to the Monday (or, at the discretion of the minister, to the next suitable weekday). But a Festival may not be celebrated on Sundays in Advent, Lent or Eastertide. Festivals coinciding with a Principal Feast or Principal Holy Day are transferred to the first available day.

One of these Festivals might be the Patronal or Dedication Festival, which can be observed either as a Festival or as a Principal Feast. According to the [Rules],

> When kept as Principal Feasts, the Patronal and Dedication Festivals may be transferred to the nearest Sunday, unless that day is already a Principal Feast or one of the following days: the First Sunday of Advent, the Baptism of Christ, the First Sunday of Lent, the Fifth Sunday of Lent or Palm Sunday.

If it falls on one of those days, it must be transferred.

## The Naming and Circumcision of Jesus (1 January) {#naming}

If Jesus was born on 25 December, he was circumcised on 1 January.

* **Numbers 6.22-27** connects the Aaronic blessing with the Lord's name: 'So they shall put my name on the Israelites'.
* **Psalm 8** (see _BCP+_) says to the Lord, 'how glorious is your name'.
* **Galatians 4.4-7** says that Jesus was 'born under the law', which explains why he was circumcised.
* **Luke 2.15-21** (see _BCP_) says, 'After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.'

## The Conversion of Paul (25 January) {#paul}

According to [rule 6][Lectionary Rules] at the top of the lectionary,

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Conversion of Paul ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

Most of the readings are about the nations/Gentiles hearing and responding to God's message.

* **Jeremiah 1.4-10** is about Jeremiah's call as 'a prophet to the nations'. (See below for the alternative, **Acts 9.1-22**.)
* **Psalm 67** (see _BCP+_) says, 'let all the peoples praise you'.
* **Acts 9.1-22** (see _BCP_) is the account of Saul/Paul's experience on the road to Damascus, in which the Lord says of him, 'he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles'.
* Alternatively, the passage from Acts can be the first reading, with **Galatians 1.11-16a** as the second reading, in which Paul says that God 'was pleased to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles'.
* **Matthew 19.27-30** (see _BCP_) is Jesus' promise to those who have 'left everything and followed [him]', which is the essence of conversion.

## Joseph of Nazareth (19 March) {#joseph}

19 March always falls during Lent. According to the [Rules],

> When St Joseph’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter or, if the Annunciation has already been moved to that date, to the first available day thereafter.

* **2 Samuel 7.4-16** is God's message to David, saying of David's son, 'I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.'
* **Psalm 89.26-36** has God saying of David, 'He shall call to me, "You are my Father,"' and 'His seed shall endure for ever'.
* **Romans 4.13-18** moves (apparently) from the idea of Jesus being treated as Joseph's son, to the idea of believers being treated as descendants of Abraham.
* **Matthew 1.18-25** is about Joseph, who 'took [Mary] as his wife', and 'named [her son] Jesus'.

## The Annunciation of Our Lord to the Blessed Virgin Mary (25 March) {#annunciation}

This is a Principal Feast, but it comes across as somewhat unwanted, as it is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast). 25 March always fall during Lent, or very occasionally on or just after Easter Day. According to the [Rules],

> the Annunciation, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to the Monday following or, falling between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.

* **Isaiah 7.10-14** (see _BCP+_) says, 'Look, the young woman [Gk _the virgin_] is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.'
* **Psalm 40.5-11** (EV: 5-10) reflects Mary's response: 'In the scroll of the book it is written of me that I should do your will, O my God; I delight to do it: your law is within my heart.'
* **Hebrews 10.4-10** quotes Psalm 40 in relation to Jesus: 'a body you have prepared for me ... Then I said, "See, God, I have come to do your will, O God" (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).'
* **Luke 1.26-38** (see _BCP_) is about the visit of Gabriel to Mary: 'you will conceive in your womb and bear a son', concluding with Mary saying, 'Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.'

## George, Martyr, Patron of England (23 April) {#george}

23 April always falls during the Easter season or on Good Friday or Easter Eve (Easter always falls between 22 March and 25 April), so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast), and it is always celebrated during the Easter season. According to the [Rules],

> When St George’s Day or St Mark’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter. If both fall in this period, St George’s Day is transferred to the Monday and St Mark’s Day to the Tuesday.

The readings reflect themes of martyrdom (looking for hope beyond death) and of dragons and other dangerous animals.

* **1 Maccabees 2.59-64** (from the Apocrypha) says, 'Daniel, because of his innocence, was delivered from the mouth of the lions.'
* Alternatively, **Revelation 12.7-12** says, 'The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan', and speaks of those who 'did not cling to life even in the face of death'.
* **Psalm 126** says, 'Those who sow in tears shall reap with songs of joy.'
* **2 Timothy 2.3-13** says, 'Share in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.'
* **John 15.18-21** is from a portion of John's Gospel that features during the Easter season, and has Jesus saying, 'If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me before it hated you.'

## Mark the Evangelist (25 April) {#mark}

25 April always falls during the Easter season, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast). See above on George (23 April).

* **Proverbs 15.28-33** (see _BCP+_) speaks of 'good news', reflecting Mark's role in writing the 'good news' (Mark 1.1), and speaks of those who 'gain understanding', perhaps reflecting Mark's growth in wisdom after initially deserting Paul and Barnabas (Acts 15.38).
* Alternatively, **Acts 15.35-41** is the account of Paul and Barnabas parting company, after disagreeing about whether 'to take with them John called Mark'.
* **Psalm 119.9-16** (see _BCP+_) speaks of 'young people' (Mark presumably being a young man at the start of his ministry), and says, 'I will not forget your word', pointing to Mark's work in writing his Gospel.
* **Ephesians 4.7-16** (see _BCP_) says, 'The gifts [Christ] gave were that some would be ... evangelists', and says that the church grows through 'speaking the truth in love'.
* **Mark 13.5-13** speaks of persecution (according to tradition, Mark was martyred), and says, 'the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations'.

## Philip and James, Apostles (1 May) {#pj}

1 May always falls during the Easter season, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

Two of the Twelve are called James; this is James 'the Less', son of Alphaeus.

Little is known of Philip or James. The readings reflect Philip's desire to see the Father, and Jesus' response to Philip: 'Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.'

* **Isaiah 30.15-21** says, 'your eyes shall see your Teacher'.
* **Psalm 119.1-8** says, 'Blessed are those who ... seek him with their whole heart'.
* **Ephesians 1.3-10** says that 'the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ... has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing' and 'has made known to us the mystery of his will'.
* **John 14.1-14** (see _BCP_) has Philip saying to Jesus, 'Lord, show us the Father,' prompting the response from Jesus: 'Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.'

## Matthias the Apostle (14 May) {#matthias}

14 May always falls between Easter and Trinity, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

According to [rule 6][Lectionary Rules] at the top of the lectionary,

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of Matthias ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **Isaiah 22.15-25** is about Shebna being thrust from his office and Eliakim taking his place (as Matthias took the place of Judas).
* **Psalm 15** says that the one who 'leads an uncorrupt life ... shall never fall' (like Matthias, and unlike Judas).
* **Acts 1.15-26** (see _BCP_) is about Matthias being chosen by the 'Lord' (Jesus) to take the place of Judas.
* **John 15.9-17** has Jesus saying, 'You did not choose me but I chose you'.

## The Visit of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Elizabeth (31 May) {#visit}

Also known as the Visitation.

31 May usually falls between Easter and Trinity, so this Festival can rarely be celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

* **Zephaniah 3.14-18** calls on 'daughter Zion' to rejoice, because 'The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, your God, is in your midst'.
* **Psalm 113** (see _BCP+_) says that God 'raises the poor from the dust' and 'gives the barren woman a place in the house and makes her a joyful mother of children'.
* **Romans 12.9-16** says, 'Rejoice with those who rejoice'.
* **Luke 1.39-49 [50-56]** (see _BCP_) has Mary visiting Elizabeth after the annunciation. At Mary's greeting, the child in Elizabeth's womb (John the Baptist) leaps for joy, Elizabeth cries out, 'Blessed...', and Mary responds with the Magnificat.

## Barnabas the Apostle (11 June) {#barnabas}

11 June occasionally falls before Trinity (20 June at the latest).

According to [rule 6][Lectionary Rules] at the top of the lectionary,

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... Barnabas ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

Barnabas first appears in Acts 4.32-37, which says that his name means 'son of encouragement', and that he sold a field in order to help believers who were in need.

* **Job 29.11-16** (see _BCP+_) has Job saying, 'I delivered the poor who cried,' and, 'I was a father to the needy'.
* **Psalm 112** (see _BCP+_) says that the righteous 'have given freely to the poor'.
* **Acts 11.19-30** (see _BCP_) has Barnabas being sent from Jerusalem to Antioch, and then being sent back (with Saul) in order to 'send relief to the believers living in Judea'.
* Alternatively, the passage from Acts can be the first reading, with **Galatians 2.1-10** as the second reading, which is about Paul's visit to Jerusalem with Barnabas, including the request they received to 'remember the poor'.

* Alternatively, **Galatians 3.23-29** speaks of the law preparing the way for Christ.
* **Luke 1.57-66, 80** (see _BCP_) is about the birth of John the Baptist.

## Peter and Paul, Apostles, or Peter the Apostle (29 June) {#peter}

The readings differ slightly, depending on whether Peter and Paul are celebrated together, or Peter alone.

Both Peter and Paul faced persecution and martyrdom, and this is reflected in the readings.

* _Peter and Paul:_ **Zechariah 4.1-6a, 10b-14** is the vision of the two olive trees (see Revelation 11), which have been associated with Peter and Paul.
* _Peter alone:_ **Ezekiel 3.22-27** is part of Ezekiel's calling as a prophet, and includes 'cords shall be placed on you, and you shall be bound with them' (see Acts 12).

* **Matthew 16.13-19** (see _BCP_) is Peter's declaration of Jesus as Messiah, with Jesus' response: 'you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it'.

## Thomas the Apostle (3 July) {#thomas}

* **Habakkuk 2.1-4** says, 'the righteous live by their faith', reflecting the mention in the Gospel reading of 'those who have not seen and yet have come to believe'.
* **Psalm 31.1-6** emphasises that faith is better than sight: 'I hate those who cling to worthless idols; I put my trust in the Lord.'
* **Ephesians 2.19-22** (see _BCP_) speaks of the church as being 'built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone'.
* **John 20.24-29** (see _BCP_) is about Thomas believing only after seeing the risen Jesus, who then said, 'Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.'

According to [rule 6][Lectionary Rules] at the top of the lectionary,

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... James ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

Two of the Twelve are called James; this is James 'the Great', son of Zebedee and elder brother of John, and the first of the Twelve to suffer martyrdom (Acts 12.2).

* **Jeremiah 45.1-5** gives assurance in the face of death: 'I will give you your life as a prize of war in every place to which you may go'.
* **Psalm 126** says, 'Those who sow in tears shall reap with songs of joy.'

* **Isaiah 61.10-11** says, 'I will greatly rejoice in the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, my whole being shall exult in my God', echoing the Magnificat.
* Alternatively, **Revelation 11.19 &ndash; 12.6, 10** is John's vision of 'a woman clothed with the sun' who 'gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron'. (The 'ark of his covenant' [11.19] has also been taken as a reference to Mary.)

* Alternatively, the passage from Acts can be the first reading, with **1 Corinthians 4.9-15** as the second reading, in which Paul says, 'I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death'.
* **Luke 22.24-30** (see _BCP_) has Jesus saying, 'the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves', perhaps hinting at Bartholomew's martyrdom, or at his lack of prominence among the apostles.

## Holy Cross Day (14 September) {#holycross}

This is also known as the Feast of the 'Exaltation of the Cross', and has its origins in more than one event associated with the cross and Jerusalem. The theme of exaltation is reflected in the readings.

* **Psalm 22.23-28** expresses praise to the Lord, who 'has not despised nor abhorred the suffering of the poor', which fits with the theme of the crucified one being exalted.
* **Philippians 2.6-11** is about Christ humbling himself to 'death on a cross' and subsequently being exalted.

* **Proverbs 3.13-18** says that wisdom is better than silver and gold.
* **Psalm 119.65-72** (see _BCP+_) says that God's law is 'dearer to me than a hoard of gold and silver'.
* **2 Corinthians 4.1-6** (see _BCP_) has several possible connections with Matthew: renouncing 'shameful things', the 'open statement of the truth' (in writing his Gospel), light shining into Matthew's heart.
* **Matthew 9.9-13** (see _BCP_) tells of Jesus calling Matthew the tax-collector to follow him, and of Jesus eating with 'tax-collectors and sinners'.

## Michael and All Angels (29 September) {#michael}

Michael the archangel is mentioned four times in Scripture: Daniel 10.13-21 and 12.1, Jude 9 and Revelation 12.7.

* **Genesis 28.10-17** is Jacob's dream of a 'ladder' with 'the angels of God ... ascending and descending on it', which is echoed in the Gospel reading.
* See below for the alternative, **Revelation 12.7-12**.
* **Psalm 103.19-22** (see _BCP+_) says, 'Bless the Lord, you angels of his'.
* **Revelation 12.7-12** (see _BCP_) is about 'Michael and his angels' fighting against 'the dragon ... and his angels'.
* Alternatively, the passage from Revelation can be the first reading, with **Hebrews 1.5-14** as the second reading, contrasting angels with the Son: see 1.1-4 and 2.1-4.
* **John 1.47-51** has Jesus saying to Nathanael, 'you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man', echoing the Old Testament reading.

## Luke the Evangelist (18 October) {#luke}

Luke was a 'physician' (Colossians 4.14). This is reflected in the readings. (Elsewhere, Luke is mentioned by name only in 2 Timothy 4.11 and Philemon 24.)

* **Isaiah 35.3-6** (see _BCP+_) is about the restoration of health.
* Alternatively, **Acts 16.6-12a** contains the first 'we' of the narrative, subtly indicating the point at which Luke joined Paul and his companions.
* **Psalm 147.1-7** (see _BCP+_) says that the Lord 'heals the brokenhearted and binds up all their wounds'.
* **2 Timothy 4.5-17** (see _BCP_) says, 'Only Luke is with me.'
* **Luke 10.1-9** (see _BCP_) is about the mission of the seventy, which perhaps speaks more directly to those (such as Luke) who are not numbered among the Twelve. (Luke has at times been numbered among the [seventy disciples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_disciples).) They were sent out to 'cure the sick' and to speak of the 'kingdom of God', which is appropriate to Luke as a physician and the author of one of the Gospels.

## Simon and Jude, Apostles (28 October) {#sj}

Simon, one of the Twelve (not Peter), appears as 'the Cananaean' in Matthew 10.4 and Mark 3.18, and as 'the Zealot' in Luke 6.15 and Acts 1.13.

Jude, one of the Twelve, is mentioned as 'Judas son of James' in Luke 6.16 and Acts 1.13, as 'Judas (not Iscariot)' when he asks a question in John 14.22, and (presumably) as 'Thaddaeus' (or 'Lebbaeus') in Matthew 10.3 and as 'Thaddaeus' in Mark 3.18. The Greek behind 'son of James' is simply 'of James', which has historically led many (especially in the West) to identify this Jude with the author of the Epistle of Jude (who describes himself as 'Jude ... brother of James'), who is identified with 'Judas', a brother of Jesus, mentioned in Matthew 13.55 and Mark 6.3.

According to tradition, Simon and Jude worked together as evangelists and were martyred together.

* **Ephesians 2.19-22** speaks of the church as being 'built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone'. **Isaiah 28.14-16** (see _BCP+_) has God speaking of 'a foundation stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation'. **Psalm 119.89-96** reflects the theme of foundations: the Lord's word 'stands firm', the Lord has 'established the earth', and the Lord's 'judgements stand firm'.
* **John 15.17-27** (see _BCP_) reflects Simon and Jude's calling, by speaking of persecution and of Jesus' command to his disciples to 'testify'.

## Andrew the Apostle (30 November) {#andrew}

30 November, if it is a Sunday, falls on the First Sunday of Advent, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (not even if it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

'In the Anglican Communion, St Andrewstide is widely observed by intercessions for foreign missions.'[^Andrew] This is the emphasis in the readings.

* **Romans 10.12-18** (see _BCP_) is about the good news being proclaimed 'to all the earth', echoing Jesus' call to Andrew. The other two readings are quoted: **Isaiah 52.7-10** ('How beautiful ... are the feet') and **Psalm 19.1-6** ('... their words to the ends of the world').
* **Matthew 4.18-22** (see _BCP_) has Jesus calling two pairs of brothers as his first followers: Simon Peter and Andrew, followed by James and John. To the first pair, Jesus says, 'Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.'

## Stephen, Deacon, First Martyr (26 December) {#stephen}

According to [rule 6][Lectionary Rules] at the top of the lectionary,

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... Stephen, the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **2 Chronicles 24.20-22** (see _BCP+_) is about the stoning of Zechariah (who said as he was dying, 'May the Lord see and avenge!').
* See below for the alternative, **Acts 7.51-60**.
* **Psalm 119.161-168** (see _BCP+_) speaks of being 'persecuted ... without a cause'.
* **Acts 7.51-60** (see _BCP_) is about the stoning of Stephen (who said as he was dying, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them').
* Alternatively, the passage from Acts can be the first reading, with **Galatians 2.16b-20** as the second reading, which speaks of having been 'crucified with Christ'.
* **Matthew 10.17-22** warns of being 'put to death' because of Jesus.

## John, Apostle and Evangelist (27 December) {#john}

John the Apostle (son of Zebedee) is traditionally identified with the evangelist who wrote 'John's Gospel', with the author of the 'Letters of John', and with the author of the Book of Revelation.

* **Psalm 117** may have been chosen because John's testimony was for all nations.
* **1 John 1** (see _BCP_) is about John's eyewitness testimony.
* **John 21.19b-25** (see _BCP_) says that 'the disciple whom Jesus loved', 'the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper', was the one who wrote this Gospel. **Exodus 33.7-11a** (see _BCP+_) speaks of a similarly close relationship: 'the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend'.

## The Holy Innocents (28 December) {#innocents}

The infants of Bethlehem are often celebrated as martyrs, and this may be reflected in the readings.

* **Psalm 124** speaks of having 'escaped', as the infant Jesus (and the other infants?) escaped from Herod.
* **1 Corinthians 1.26-29** speaks of God choosing 'what is weak in the world to shame the strong', inviting a contrast between the infant Jesus (and the other infants?) and Herod.
* **Matthew 2.13-18** (see _BCP_) says that Herod 'killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under'. **Jeremiah 31.15-17** (see _BCP+_) is quoted: 'Rachel weeping for her children'.

## Dedication Festival

According to the [Rules],

> The Dedication Festival of a church is the anniversary of the date of its dedication or consecration. This is kept either as a Festival or as a Principal Feast.

Year A

* **1 Kings 8.22-30** is Solomon's prayer of dedication for the temple.
* Alternatively, **Revelation 21.9-14** speaks of the walls and gates of the 'holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God'.
* **Psalm 122** (see _BCP+_) says, 'I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the Lord."'
* **Hebrews 12.18-24** says that believers 'have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem'.
* **Matthew 21.12-16** (see _BCP+_) says that Jesus 'drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple'.

Year B

* **Genesis 28.11-18** is about Jacob's vision: 'This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.'
* Alternatively, **Revelation 21.9-14**: see Year A.
* **Psalm 122**: see Year A.
* **1 Peter 2.1-10** (see _BCP+_) likens believers to 'living stones', being built into a spiritual house'.
* **John 10.22-29** (see _BCP+_) is set in Jerusalem at the time of 'the festival of the Dedication'.

Year C

* **Psalm 122**: see Year A.
* **Ephesians 2.19-22** speaks of believers growing into 'a holy temple in the Lord'.
* **John 2.13-22** speaks of Jesus driving people out of the temple and saying, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.'

## Harvest Thanksgiving

Based on the _RCL_ readings for Thanksgiving Day.

Year A

* **Deuteronomy 8.7-18** (see _BCP+_) speaks of God bringing his people into a fruitful land, and warns against forgetting God in times of plenty.
* Alternatively, **Deuteronomy 28.1-14** speaks of the blessings that follow from obedience.
* **Psalm 65** (see _BCP+_) says, 'You visit the earth and water it; you make it very plenteous.'
* **2 Corinthians 9.6-15** speaks of sowing and reaping for 'the harvest of your righteousness'.
* **Luke 12.16-30** is about the rich man and his barns, and about not worrying about food or clothing (compare Year B). (Verse 31 could also be included.)
* Alternatively, **Luke 17.11-19** is about the ten lepers, only one of whom returned to praise God.

Year B

* **Joel 2.21-27** is about God bringing fruitfulness, after the invasion of locusts: 'the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> has done great things'.
* **Psalm 126** says, 'The Lord has done great things', and, 'Those who go out weeping, bearing the seed, will come back with shouts of joy, bearing their sheaves with them.'
* **1 Timothy 2.1-7** calls for 'supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings'.
* Alternatively, **1 Timothy 6.6-10** is about contentment: 'if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these'.
* **Matthew 6.25-33** is about not worrying about food or clothing (compare Year A). (Verse 34 could also be included.)

Year C

* **Deuteronomy 26.1-11** (see _BCP+_) is about offering some of the first fruits of the harvest, and calls the people to 'celebrate'.
* **Psalm 100** calls for joy and thanksgiving.
* **Philippians 4.4-9** is a call to 'rejoice' and to offer 'prayer and supplication with thanksgiving'.
* Alternatively, **Revelation 14.14-18** is about 'one like the Son of Man' reaping the harvest of the earth.
* **John 6.25-35** says (after the feeding of the 5000), 'Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life'.

# Appendix: Gospels

What follows is a complete index to each of the four Gospels, showing which passages are included, which are omitted but have a parallel passage included from one of the other Gospels, and which are simply omitted. See the [Introduction](#introduction) for a broad overview of how the Gospels are treated in the lectionary.

For Matthew, Mark and Luke, the semicontinuous series from Epiphany 3 to the end of Ordinary Time is shown in bold.

It is difficult to quantify how much material is included from the Synoptic Gospels, without first creating a harmony of the Gospels. In one English Version, the Synoptic Gospels have 61,615 words, of which around 10,147 words are in the passages listed below as 'omitted'. This would mean that 84% of the material in the Synoptic Gospels is included, making certain assumptions about how likely it is that included or omitted passages have a parallel in another Gospel.
