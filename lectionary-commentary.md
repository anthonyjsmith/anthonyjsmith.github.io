This is a commentary on the _lectionary_, not a commentary on the _passages_. The aim is to answer the question: _Why was this passage chosen?_

Simply search below for the relevant day, e.g., 'Advent 1', 'Proper 21', 'Bartholomew'.

Most of the comments below are 'reverse engineered' using the lectionary and a fair bit of guesswork, so they should not be taken as authoritative.

# Introduction {#introduction}

**Common Worship** was introduced in the Church of England in 2000. It includes a [Lectionary for Sundays, Principal Feasts and Holy Days, and Festivals](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary), which provides a lectionary for three services on each of those days: Principal Service, Second Service, and Third Service (along with 'Evening Prayer on the Eve' for some occasions). This page covers the **Principal Service Lectionary**, which is drawn (with modifications) from the ecumenical **Revised Common Lectionary (RCL)**.

Note that there is often no 'theme' tying the readings together. (Many people persist in looking for one, even decades after the ASB.) Where readings are closely related, they are grouped together below. In many cases, however, a particular reading will not be related to other readings on the same day, but it will turn out to be part of a series on a particular book of the Bible running over several weeks. This principle of continuous (or semicontinuous) reading of Scripture is one of the key principles behind the lectionary.

## The Bible and the lectionary

I have put the Principal Service Lectionary into a [spreadsheet](/assets/lectionary.xlsx), including a 'reverse lectionary' as the second sheet (listing the passages in biblical order).

For the Gospels, Year A focuses on Matthew, Year B on Mark, and Year C on Luke.

John is read in all three years, mostly during the seasons (especially Easter), but with some appearances in Ordinary Time in Year B (such as a summer series on John 6).

The Gospel readings on Sundays during Ordinary Time work semicontinuously through the central portions of Matthew, Mark and Luke. More precisely, this actually begins just before Ordinary Time, in Epiphany 3, with the start of Jesus' public ministry (or at least, it does in the RCL: see notes on Epiphany 3), continuing into February until 3 before Lent, and then the series resumes after Trinity, continuing until the Sunday before Advent. (The one exception is Year B, 3 before Advent, Mark 1.14-20.) Material from Matthew 1.1 &ndash; 4.11, Mark 1.1-13 and Luke 1.1 &ndash; 4.13 is included in Advent, Christmas, Epiphany 1 and Lent (along with extracts from other chapters), and the resurrection accounts are included during Easter. Note that the Passion narratives (Matthew 26-27, Mark 14-15 and Luke 22-23), with one or two small exceptions, are included _only_ on Palm Sunday, within the Liturgy of the Passion. See the [Appendix](#appendix-gospels) for details.

Acts is read at the Baptism of Christ, between Easter Day and Pentecost (vaguely sequentially), and on some Festivals.

Numerous Psalms are included.

Many other books are read semicontinuously, while also featuring in a non-sequential way during seasons and Festivals and as 'Related' Old Testament readings after Trinity.

Old Testament 'Continuous' readings after Trinity cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A (Pentateuch): Genesis, Exodus and Deuteronomy 34
* Year B (History and Wisdom): 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings (up to chapter 8), and selections from Song of Solomon, Proverbs, Esther and Job
* Year C (Prophets): 1 Kings 17 &ndash; 2 Kings 5 (Elijah and Elisha), Amos, Hosea, Isaiah (briefly!), Jeremiah, Lamentations and Joel

New Testament readings after Trinity and before Advent cover the following books sequentially (but not completely):

* Year A: Romans, Philippians and 1 Thessalonians
* Year B: 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, James and Hebrews 1-10
* Year C: Galatians, Colossians, Hebrews 11-13, Philemon, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and 2 Thessalonians

Other semicontinuous treatments of New Testament books are as follows:

* 1 Corinthians:
  * Year A: chapters 1-3 for three Sundays in Epiphany and in February
  * Year B: chapter 9 for two Sundays in February (RCL also features chapters 6-8 in Epiphany 2-4)
  * Year C: chapters 12-13 for two Sundays in Epiphany, followed by chapter 15 for three Sundays in February
* 1 Peter: Easter season, Year A
* 1 John: Easter season, Year B
* Revelation: Easter season, Year C (also three Sundays in Epiphany, Year B, not sequential)

What about those parts of the Bible that are not read sequentially?

* Old Testament
  * Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Jonah, Micah, Zephaniah and Malachi: included, but not in a systematic way
  * Judges, Ruth, Ezra, Obadiah, Nahum and Haggai: not included
  * 1 and 2 Chronicles: not included (outside Festivals)
  * Ecclesiastes, Habakkuk and Zechariah: once as a 'Related' reading
  * Isaiah: features prominently in Advent, Christmas and Epiphany, and at other times (not sequential)
* New Testament
  * Titus: included, but not in a systematic way
  * 2 Peter: included, but not in a systematic way
  * 2 John, 3 John, Jude: not included

## Choosing between the readings

It is worth noting rule 5 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a), which gives permission to extend the readings:

> In a compact cycle of readings such as these, some passages have necessarily been abbreviated. When opportunity allows, the passages may be read in full. Verses in brackets may be included or omitted, as desired.

Each service has the following readings:

* **Old Testament reading** (or sometimes a reading from Acts),
* **psalm or canticle** (usually a response to the first reading),
* **New Testament reading** (from an epistle or Revelation), and
* **Gospel reading**.

The psalm or canticle should normally be used, along with two or three of the other readings. When using just two of the other readings, Common Worship specifies:

> When there are only two readings at the principal service and that service is Holy Communion, the second reading is always the Gospel reading. ...
>
> When the Principal Service Lectionary is used at a service other than Holy Communion, the Gospel reading need not always be chosen.

In addition, when the first reading is from Acts, it must be included as one of the readings.

Note that in Common Worship Holy Communion (Order One or Two), 'Either one or two readings from Scripture precede the Gospel reading', and 'The psalm or canticle follows the first reading'. As the psalm or canticle is usually related to the Old Testament reading, this makes a lot of sense when that reading is used; it makes less sense when the Old Testament reading is omitted, because the psalm or canticle is often unrelated to the New Testament reading.

On the Sundays after Trinity, the Gospel reading and the New Testament reading follow separate tracks, and there are two alternative tracks for the Old Testament reading and the psalm, as explained in Common Worship:

> Those under the heading 'Continuous' allow the Old Testament reading and its complementary psalm to stand independently of the other readings. Those under the heading 'Related' relate the Old Testament reading and the psalm to the Gospel reading.

Those who prefer the readings to cohere can have their wishes partially satisfied by opting for the 'Related' Old Testament reading (and psalm), which is related to the Gospel reading. But the cost of this is that it prevents the Old Testament from speaking so clearly with its own voice. Also, there is no 'Related' alternative reading from the New Testament. (RCL provides these two tracks until the Sunday before Advent, whereas Common Worship provides only the 'Related' track for the four Sundays before Advent, with some modifications.)

## Notes

Psalm references are to the Common Worship psalter. Where the versification is different in standard English versions of the Bible, this is indicated by 'EV'. Quotations are drawn from the Common Worship psalter or the NRSV.

Depending on the day of the week for Christmas and the Epiphany, and the date of Easter, lectionary provision for days marked with * might not be used in any given year. Other days might also be displaced for various reasons.

# Advent {#advent}

The readings are more strongly related to the themes of Advent than they are to each other within each Sunday.

There is a tradition in some parts of the church of reflecting on the themes of hope, peace, joy and love on the four Sundays of Advent. The theme of hope is present on the first three Sundays, while the theme of peace is discernable on Advent 2, and joy on Advent 3.

## Advent 1

The Gospel readings all speak of the 'coming' of 'the Son of Man'.

Year A

* **Isaiah 2.1-5** begins a 'series' in Isaiah, which covers all Sundays until Proper 1, except for Christmas 2 and Epiphany 4. God's people are urged to 'walk in the light of the Lord', looking ahead to 'days to come' when the nations stream to God's house in Zion in order to walk in God's paths and find peace with each other. **Psalm 122** has people going up to 'the house of the Lord' and speaks of 'peace'.
* **Romans 13.11-14** (see BCP) is an exhortation to 'lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light' because 'the day is near'.
* **Matthew 24.36-44** urges us to 'be ready' for 'the coming of the Son of Man'.

Year B

* **Isaiah 64.1-9** begins a four-part 'series' in Isaiah 40-64 (Advent 1-3 and Christmas 1), and begins, 'O that you would tear open the heavens and come down'.
* **Psalm 80.1-8, 18-20** (EV: 1-7, 17-19) [or 80.1-8 (EV: 1-7)] calls on God to 'come to our salvation' and 'show the light of your countenance', and speaks of 'the man at your right hand, the son of man you made so strong for yourself'.
* **1 Corinthians 1.3-9** speaks of waiting 'for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ' and 'the day of our Lord Jesus Christ'.
* **Mark 13.24-37** speaks of 'the Son of Man coming in clouds' and about 'that day or hour' being unknown: 'Keep awake.'

## Advent 2

The Gospel readings all introduce John the Baptist.

Peace is a recurring theme.

Year A

* **Isaiah 11.1-10** continues in Isaiah, and speaks one who will come with the 'spirit of the Lord' and bring peace.
* **Psalm 72.1-7, 18-19** [or 72.1-7] speaks of the 'king' bringing 'justice' and 'peace': 'May he come down...'.
* **Romans 15.4-13** (see BCP) quotes Isaiah 11.10 ('The root of Jesse shall come, the one who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope': see Septuagint), speaks of living in harmony, and says, 'May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope'.
* **Matthew 3.1-12** introduces John the Baptist baptizing with water for repentance and pointing towards one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.

Year B

* **Isaiah 40.1-11** continues in Isaiah, speaks words of comfort to God's people, is quoted in the Gospel reading: 'prepare the way', and looks to the coming of the Lord. **Psalm 85.1-2, 8-13** [or 85.8-13] says of God: 'he shall speak peace to his people ... that they turn not again to folly'.
* **2 Peter 3.8-15a** says, 'the day of the Lord will come like a thief', and calls for repentance and peace: 'lives of holiness and godliness ... strive to be found by him at peace, without spot or blemish'.
* **Mark 1.1-8** quotes Isaiah 40.3 ('Prepare the way'), and is about John the Baptist 'proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins' in order to prepare the way for Jesus.

## Advent 3

The Gospel readings all continue with John the Baptist.

Joy is a recurring theme, echoing this Sunday being celebrated widely in Western Christianity as 'Gaudete Sunday', from _Gaudete_, 'Rejoice', in Philippians 4.4.

Year A

Four themes are present in the readings: the coming of the Lord, preparing the way, blind eyes being opened, and rejoicing.

* **Isaiah 35.1-10** continues in Isaiah, and is a call to 'rejoice with joy' in the light of God coming, reversing fortunes, strengthening the weak, opening the eyes of the blind, and a 'highway' being there.
* **Psalm 146.4-10** (EV: 5-10) connects hope with joy ('Happy are those ... whose hope is in the Lord their God'), and says, 'the Lord opens the eyes of the blind'.
* Alternatively, the canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, which is a song of joy, and is about fortunes being reversed.
* **James 5.7-10** says, 'Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.'
* **Matthew 11.2-11** (see BCP) has Jesus sending a message to John the Baptist about blind eyes being opened, and speaking about John the Baptist preparing the way.

Year B

Three themes are present in the readings: the coming of the Lord, anointing, and joy.

* **Isaiah 61.1-4, 8-11** continues in Isaiah, and says, 'The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me', to give 'the oil of gladness', and calling for a response of joy: 'I will greatly rejoice in the Lord'.
* **Psalm 126** is a psalm of joy: 'The Lord has indeed done great things for us, and therefore we rejoiced', and looks ahead to a future restoration of fortunes.
* Alternatively, the canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, which is a song of joy: 'my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour'.
* **1 Thessalonians 5.16-24** could be seen as concluding the series in 1 Thessalonians from the end of Year A, and says 'Rejoice always', looking ahead to 'the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ'.
* **John 1.6-8, 19-28** is about the testimony of John concerning Jesus the Messiah (anointed one).

## Advent 4

The Gospel readings all look towards Jesus' birth to Mary.

Year A

* **Isaiah 7.10-16** continues in Isaiah, and looks ahead to a young woman bearing a son and calling him Immanuel.
* **Psalm 80.1-8, 18-20** (EV: 1-7, 17-19) [or 80.1-8 (EV: 1-7)] calls on God to 'come to our salvation' and 'show the light of your countenance', and speaks of 'the man at your right hand, the son of man you made so strong for yourself'. 
* **Romans 1.1-7** says that Jesus 'was descended from David according to the flesh'.
* **Matthew 1.18-25** leads up to the birth of Jesus to Mary, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about 'Emmanuel'.

Year B

The readings reflect the theme of God's promises being fulfilled.

* **2 Samuel 7.1-11, 16** is God's promise to David: 'Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before me; your throne shall be established for ever.'
* The canticle is the **Magnificat (Luke 1.46-55)**, the song of Mary: 'He has come to the aid of his servant Israel, to remember his promise of mercy'.
* Alternatively, **Psalm 89.1-4, 19-26** [or 89.1-8] speaks of God's promise to David: 'Your seed will I establish for ever and build up your throne for all generations.'
* **Luke 1.26-38** is the annunciation to Mary, 'engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David', and says of Jesus, that 'the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David'. Mary's response is, 'let it be with me according to your word'. **Romans 16.25-27** speaks about 'the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages ... to bring about the obedience of faith', reflecting Mary's response of obedient faith.

# Christmas {#christmas}

## Christmas Day

Set I (emphasis on the salvation Jesus brings)

* **Isaiah 9.2-7** speaks of those in darkness seeing 'a great light', and announces that 'a child has been born', who will be named 'Wonderful Counsellor...', and who will reign 'with justice and with righteousness'.
* **Psalm 96** calls for rejoicing before the Lord, because 'he comes, he comes to judge the earth', 'with righteousness'.
* **Titus 2.11-14** says that 'the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all' through Jesus, who 'gave himself for us'.
* **Luke 2.1-14 [15-20]** is about Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, the angels appearing to the shepherds and announcing the birth of a Saviour, [and the shepherds going to Bethlehem to 'see'].

Set II (emphasis on God's glory appearing and being seen)

* **Isaiah 62.6-12** begins by speaking of king and nations who will 'see ... your glory', and says to Zion, 'See, your salvation comes'.
* **Psalm 97** says of the Lord that 'all the peoples have seen his glory'.
* **Titus 3.4-7** speaks of 'when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Saviour appeared'.
* **Luke 2.[1-7] 8-20** is about [Jesus' birth in Bethlehem], the angels appearing to the shepherds and announcing the birth of a Saviour, and the shepherds going to Bethlehem to 'see'.

Set III (emphasis on Jesus' divinity)

* **Isaiah 52.7-10** speaks of 'the return of the Lord to Zion', and says that he 'has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations'.
* **Psalm 98** speaks of the Lord bring victory by his 'own right hand and his holy arm', and calls for rejoicing before the Lord, because 'he comes to judge the earth'.
* **Hebrews 1.1-4 [5-12]** (see BCP) speaks of the 'Son' through whom God 'created the worlds', who is 'the exact imprint of God's very being', and who is 'superior to angels'. [When God 'brings the firstborn into the world', the angels worship him.]
* **John 1.1-14** (see BCP) speaks of the 'Word' who 'was God', through whom 'all things came into being', and who 'became flesh'.

## Christmas 1

These readings are used on the first Sunday _after_ Christmas.

The psalm is the same for Years A, B and C.

* **Psalm 148** [or 148.7-14] calls on the whole earth to praise the Lord, because he has 'raised up the horn of his people'.

Year A

The focus is on the Holy Innocents, celebrated on 28 December, which may coincide with Christmas 1.

* **Matthew 2.13-23** is part of the infancy narrative in Matthew, and describes Jesus being taken to Egypt to flee from Herod; the Massacre of the Innocents, and the returning of the Holy Family from Egypt. It therefore glimpses the suffering and exaltation of Jesus, which is reflected in the other readings. **Isaiah 63.7-9** continues in Isaiah, and reflects the Massacre of the Innocents: 'Surely they are my people, children who will not deal falsely ... in his love ... he lifted them up'. **Hebrews 2.10-18** is about God 'bringing many children to glory' through the incarnation and suffering of Jesus.

Year B

The focus is on the naming and circumcision of Jesus, celebrated on 1 January, which may coincide with Christmas 1.

* **Luke 2.15-21** begins with the response of the shepherds, and concludes with the naming and circumcision of Jesus. **Isaiah 61.10 &ndash; 62.3** reflects the theme of naming: 'you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow'. **Galatians 4.4-7** (see BCP) says that Jesus was 'born under the law', which explains why he was circumcised.

## Christmas 2*

These readings are used on the second Sunday _after_ Christmas, if there is one before the Epiphany. In other words, these readings apply only when there is a Sunday between 2 and 5 January, and when the Epiphany is not being celebrated on that day.

Years A, B and C

* **Jeremiah 31.7-14** has God showing grace to his people: 'I will comfort them'.
* Alternatively, **Ecclesiasticus 24.1-12** (from the Apocrypha) speaks of 'Wisdom', who 'came from the mouth of the Most High' (like the Word), and who was told by the Creator: 'Make your dwelling in Jacob' (like the Word becoming flesh).
* **Psalm 147.13-21** (EV: 12-20) praises God because he 'sends forth his command to the earth' and 'sends forth his word' (like the Word becoming flesh).
* Alternatively (as a canticle to follow the reading from Ecclesiasticus), **Wisdom of Solomon 10.15-21** (from the Apocrypha) is about wisdom.
* **Ephesians 1.3-14** praises God for 'his glorious grace' and speaks of God's plan 'to gather up all things in [Christ], things in heaven and things on earth' (as heaven and earth are brought together in the incarnation).
* **John 1.[1-9] 10-18** (see BCP) says that 'the Word became flesh', and that 'From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.'

# Epiphany {#epiphany}

Although the Sundays are the Sundays _of_ Epiphany, if the Epiphany falls on a Sunday, the readings are moved to the following week. In other words, the readings for Epiphany N are used on the Nth Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (as in the RCL).

Note that the RCL considers the 'Season of Epiphany' to be part of 'Ordinary Time', and to cover the whole period between the Epiphany and Lent.

## The Epiphany

May be celebrated on the Sunday between 2 and 8 January (the second Sunday _after_ Christmas).

Years A, B and C

* **Matthew 2.1-12** (see BCP) recounts the visit of 'wise men from the East' to the child Jesus in Bethlehem. **Isaiah 60.1-6** says that 'Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn', adding that 'They shall bring gold and frankincense'. **Psalm 72.[1-9] 10-15** speaks of kings bringing gifts (including gold) to 'the king'. **Ephesians 3.1-12** (see BCP) is about the Gentiles becoming 'fellow-heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel'.

## The Baptism of Christ: Epiphany 1

These readings are used on the first Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (the Sunday between 7 and 13 January).

Celebrated on Monday 8 or 9 January if the Epiphany is celebrated on Sunday 7 or 8 January.

The psalm is the same for Years A, B and C.

* **Psalm 29** is about the 'voice of the Lord', including: 'The voice of the Lord is upon the waters'.

Year A

* **Matthew 3.13-17** is Matthew's account of the baptism of Jesus, with 'the Spirit of God' descending on him, and 'a voice from heaven' saying, 'This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.' **Isaiah 42.1-9** continues in Isaiah, is echoed in the Gospel reading: 'Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights'. **Acts 10.34-43** speaks of 'how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit' (as Peter shares the gospel with a Gentile, reflecting the Epiphany season).

Year B

* **Mark 1.4-11** describes John the Baptist's ministry of baptism ('I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit'), and has Jesus being baptised by John, with 'the Spirit' descending on him, and 'a voice ... from heaven'. **Genesis 1.1-5** says, 'a wind from God [or 'the spirit of God'] swept over the face of the waters. Then God said ...'. **Acts 19.1-7** has Paul in Ephesus contrasting the baptism of John with baptism 'in the name of the Lord Jesus', which is accompanied by the Holy Spirit.

## Epiphany 2

These readings are used on the second Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (the Sunday between 14 and 20 January).

The Gospel readings for this Sunday cover John 1.29 &ndash; 2.11. In the RCL, it makes sense to see these readings as John's announcement of the beginning of Jesus' public ministry (with echoes of Jesus' baptism), to go alongside next week's readings from Matthew, Mark and Luke. This makes slightly less sense under Common Worship: see note on Epiphany 3.

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 1.1-9** begins a series covering almost all of 1 Corinthians 1-3. Paul gives thanks for the grace of God that has been given to the church in Corinth.
* **John 1.29-42** has John (the Baptist) saying of Jesus, 'Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world', reflecting the Epiphany season, adding that 'he was before me'. **Isaiah 49.1-7** continues in Isaiah, and has the 'servant' saying, 'The Lord called me before I was born', and the Lord saying to his servant, 'I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth'. **Psalm 40.1-12** (EV: 1-11) has the speaker saying, 'Lo, I come. In the scroll of the book it is written of me that I should do your will, O my God'.

Year B

* **Revelation 5.1-10** begins a three-part non-sequential series about the revelation of Jesus' glory in Revelation (replacing the RCL readings: 1 Corinthians 6.12-20; 7.29-31; 8.1-13), and is about the 'Lion' who is a 'Lamb', and who is 'worthy to take the scroll'.
* **John 1.43-51** has Jesus calling Philip and Nathanael, who asks, 'Where did you come to know me?' **1 Samuel 3.1-10 [11-20]** is about God calling Samuel. **Psalm 139.1-5, 12-18** (EV: 1-6, 13-18) [or 139.1-9 (EV: 1-10)] says, 'O Lord, you have searched me out and known me'.

Year C

* **John 2.1-11** (see BCP) is the account of Jesus turning water into wine, by which he 'revealed his glory' (an Epiphany theme).

## Epiphany 3

These readings are used on the third Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (the Sunday between 21 and 27 January).

In the RCL, it makes sense to see this Sunday as marking the beginning of the semicontinuous series in the respective Gospel, with the Gospel reading marking the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. Common Worship has a different approach, which emphasises the Epiphany season, partly by including John 2.1-11 in Year A (Epiphany 4) and Year B (Epiphany 3), in addition to Year C (Epiphany 2), and partly by setting the Candlemas Gospel reading for Epiphany 4 in Year C.

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 1.10-18** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (without a gap), and is about divisions in the church.
* **Matthew 4.12-23** is the beginning of Jesus' ministry, in 'Galilee of the Gentiles'. (Matthew 4.18-22 is also set for Andrew.) **Isaiah 9.1-4** continues in Isaiah, and is quoted in the Gospel reading, including: 'The people ... in darkness have seen a great light'. **Psalm 27.1, 4-12** (EV: 1, 4-9) [or 27.1-11 (EV: 1-9a)] says, 'The Lord is my light and my salvation'.

Year B

RCL has Mark 1.14-20 as the Gospel reading, with related readings from Jonah 3.1-5, 10 and Psalm 62.5-12, all of which are transferred to 3 before Advent in Common Worship.

* **Revelation 19.6-10** continues the series about the revelation of Jesus' glory in Revelation (replacing the RCL reading), and is about 'the marriage supper of the Lamb' (providing a connection with the Gospel reading).
* **John 2.1-11** is the account of Jesus turning water into wine, by which he 'revealed his glory' (an Epiphany theme). **Genesis 14.17-20** is about King Melchizedek who brings wine and is honoured by Abram. **Psalm 128** says, 'Your wife will be like a fruitful vine'.

Year C

* **Luke 4.14-21**

## Epiphany 4*

These readings are used on the fourth Sunday _after_ the Epiphany (the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February).

Displaced if Candlemas falls (or is celebrated) on a Sunday.

Year A

RCL has Matthew 5.1-12 as the Gospel reading, with related readings from Micah 6.1-8 and Psalm 15. Note that Matthew 5.1-12 is the Gospel reading for All Saints' Day. Micah 6.1-8, however, is not included elsewhere.

* **1 Corinthians 1.18-31** continues the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (overlapping by one verse), and is about 'the message of the cross' and 'Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'. (Also set for Tuesday of Holy Week.)
* **John 2.1-11** is the account of Jesus turning water into wine, by which he 'revealed his glory' (an Epiphany theme). (This account features in Years A, B and C, each time on a different Sunday of Epiphany.) **1 Kings 17.8-16** is about Elijah's provision of meal and oil to a widow who was running out. **Psalm 36.5-10** is about God's provision: 'They shall be satisfied with the abundance of your house; they shall drink from the river of your delights. For with you is the well of life'.

Year B

* **Revelation 12.1-5a** concludes the series about the revelation of Jesus' glory in Revelation (replacing the RCL reading), and is about the 'woman' and her 'son ... who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron'.
* **Mark 1.21-28** begins a semicontinuous series in Mark 1-13, which covers this Sunday, three Sundays in February, and all the Sundays after Trinity until 2 before Advent, apart from five weeks in John 6 in July and August. (The series begins more naturally in RCL with Mark 1.14-20 in Epiphany 3, but this is transferred to 3 before Advent in Common Worship.) Jesus heals a man with an unclean spirit, provoking amazement: 'A new teaching—with authority!' **Deuteronomy 18.15-20** is about the new 'prophet' like Moses who will speak God's words. **Psalm 111** praises God for his 'marvellous deeds'.

Year C

RCL has Luke 4.21-30 as the Gospel reading, which is replaced by Luke 2.22-40 (the Gospel reading for Candlemas).

## The Presentation of Christ in the Temple (Candlemas)

May be celebrated on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February (the fourth Sunday _after_ the Epiphany).

Years A, B and C

* **Luke 2.22-40** (see BCP) is the account of the child Jesus being presented in the temple, and concludes by saying that 'The child grew and became strong'. **Malachi 3.1-5** says that 'the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple', to 'purify'. **Psalm 24.[1-6] 7-10** calls for the 'gates' and 'doors' to be 'lifted up' so that the 'Lord', the 'King of glory', 'may come in' [and also speaks of the need for 'clean hands and pure hearts']. **Hebrews 2.14-18** speaks of Jesus sharing 'flesh and blood', and then doing the work of the (heavenly) temple, as 'a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people'.

(RCL 'Seventh Sunday after the Epiphany', 'Proper 2'.)

Year A

* **1 Corinthians 3.10-11, 16-23** concludes the series in 1 Corinthians 1-3 (continuing without a gap), and is about building the church on the foundation of Jesus Christ. (The omitted verses about 'the Day' could easily be included: 'the fire will test what sort of work each has done'.)

(6.39-49 is the reading for the following week in the RCL, which is omitted in Common Worship: see discussion below. To fill in the gap, this week's reading could be extended to 6.42 'when opportunity allows'.) (NB: Luke 6.20-31 set for All Saints' Day.) **Genesis 45.3-11, 15** is about Joseph's love for his brothers, who had behaved like his enemies. **Psalm 37.1-11, 40, 41** (EV: 1-11, 39, 40) [or 37.1-7] calls us not to fret about evildoers.

## 2 before Lent*

Creation theme.

The addition of this creation-themed week means that 'Proper 3' in the RCL is not included (although the Gospel reading for Year A is almost the same). The Gospel readings from that week contain several famous sayings of Jesus: see the the [Appendix](#appendix-gospels) for Mark 2.13-22 and Luke 6.39-49.

Year A

* **Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.3** is about the creation of the heavens and the earth (and could be seen as beginning a series on Genesis that continues in the summer).
* **Psalm 136** [or 136.1-9, 23-26] is about God who 'made the heavens' (5-9) and 'gives food to all creatures' (25).
* **Romans 8.18-25** says that 'the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God'.
* **Matthew 6.25-34** says, 'do not worry', and invites us to consider God's care for the birds and the 'grass of the field'. (Matthew 6.25-33 also set for Harvest Thanksgiving, Year B.)

Year B

* **Proverbs 8.1, 22-31** is about wisdom's role in creation.
* **Psalm 104.26-37** (EV: 24-35) praises God for his creation: 'In wisdom you have made them all'.
* **Colossians 1.15-20** says of God's Son that 'all things have been created through him and for him'.
* **John 1.1-14** says of the 'Word' that 'All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being.'

## 1 before Lent*

(RCL 'Last Sunday after the Epiphany', or 'Transfiguration Sunday'.)

The Gospel readings are about Jesus' Transfiguration.

Year A

* **Matthew 17.1-9** is Matthew's account of Jesus' Transfiguration, on a mountain, with Peter, James and John, with Moses and Elijah appearing, a cloud overshadowing them, and a voice saying, 'This is my Son'. **Exodus 24.12-18** is about Moses seeing the glory of the Lord on the mountain. **Psalm 2** has God saying, 'You are my Son'. Alternatively, **Psalm 99** (also set for Year C) says that God 'spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud', and calls people to 'worship him upon his holy hill'. **2 Peter 1.16-21** includes Peter's eyewitness account of the Transfiguration.

Year B

* **Mark 9.2-9** is Mark's account of Jesus' Transfiguration, on a 'high mountain', with Moses and Elijah appearing. **2 Kings 2.1-12** is about Elijah being taken up to heaven. **Psalm 50.1-6** says that God 'has spoken' and 'shines forth'. **2 Corinthians 4.3-6** speaks about 'the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ'.

# Lent {#lent}

In terms of the Gospel readings for Lent 1-5, there is some structure to the readings, with all years building towards a climax in John 11 or 12. In Lent 1, the respective Gospel reading narrates Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. The readings from Lent 2-5 have the following themes:

* Year A looks at some encounters with Jesus in John's Gospel, related to baptism. (Lent originated as a period of preparation for baptism.) After John 3 in Lent 2, with its baptismal overtones, the remaining readings cover 'the three classic passages from John's Gospel used from the earliest times for the instruction of candidates for baptism: the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4), the healing of the man born blind (John 9), and the raising of Lazarus (John 11)'.[^Lent]
* Year B looks towards Jesus' death and resurrection (one week in Mark, followed by three weeks in John), and
* Year C, mostly in Luke, is less clearly structured, and is about Jesus setting out for Jerusalem (Lent 2), then about repentance (Lent 3) and Jesus welcoming sinners (Lent 4), before finishing in John with Jesus being anointed at Bethany.

## Ash Wednesday

Falls between 4 February and 10 March.

Years A, B and C

* **Joel 2.1-2, 12-17** says, 'return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning'.
* Alternatively, **Isaiah 58.1-12** says, 'Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice ...'.
* **Psalm 51.1-18** (EV: 1-17) says, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God'.
* **2 Corinthians 5.20b &ndash; 6.10** says, 'we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God'.
* **Matthew 6.1-6, 16-21** (see BCP) is about 'your Father who sees in secret', in relation to almsgiving, prayer, fasting, and storing up treasures in heaven.
* Alternatively, **John 8.1-11** is about the woman caught in adultery: 'Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.'

## Lent 1

Year A

* **Psalm 32** is about confession and forgiveness of sin.
* **Matthew 4.1-11** (see BCP) is about Jesus being tempted by the devil in the wilderness. **Genesis 2.15-17; 3.1-7** is about Eve and Adam succumbing to the serpent's temptation in the garden. **Romans 5.12-19** compares Adam with Christ.

## Lent 2

The Old Testament reading each year is about God's promise to Abram. In the light of the fall (see last week), this could be intended as a reminder of God's gracious response to human sin.

Year A

* **Genesis 12.1-4a** is about God's call and promise to Abram, and the beginning of Abram's journey. **Psalm 121** gives assurance of God's protection on the journey. **Romans 4.1-5, 13-17** is about Abraham's faith in God's promise.
* **John 3.1-17** begins a series of baptism-related encounters with Jesus in John's Gospel, and is about Nicodemus's encounter with Jesus, with its discussion of being born 'of water and Spirit'.

## Lent 3

Year A

* **John 4.5-42** continues the baptism-related series in John, and is about the Samaritan woman's encounter with Jesus, including a discussion about 'living water' (i.e., the Spirit, 7.39), and about worshipping the Father 'in spirit and in truth'. **Exodus 17.1-7** is about Moses bringing water from the rock, in response to the people testing God at Massah and Meribah. **Psalm 95** recalls the time when the people tested God at Massah and Meribah. **Romans 5.1-11** says that 'God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit'.

## Lent 4

May be 'displaced' by Mothering Sunday.

Year A

* **John 9.1-41** continues the baptism-related series in John, and is about the blind man receiving sight by washing in water, after Jesus has said, 'I am the light of the world'. The Pharisees are 'blind' in that they cannot see who Jesus is. **1 Samuel 16.1-13** is about recognising the Lord's anointed (David). **Psalm 23** has a possible connection with the Old Testament reading ('you have anointed my head with oil'), but seems more likely to reflect the experience of the man born blind, who was led (to water) by Jesus. Note that John 9 leads directly into John 10, apparently inviting the conclusion that the man born blind is one of Jesus' sheep. **Ephesians 5.8-14** is about light and darkness.

## Mothering Sunday

The readings are related to mothering, but with a tinge of pain and hints of the cross, appropriately for Lent.

Years A, B and C

* **Exodus 2.1-10** is about Moses' mother placing her baby into the water, only to receive him back again from Pharaoh's daughter.
* Alternatively, **1 Samuel 1.20-28** is about Samuel's mother giving him to the Lord.
* **Psalm 34.11-20** says, 'Come, my children, and listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.'
* Alternatively, **Psalm 127.1-4** (EV: 1-3) says, 'Children are a heritage from the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his gift.'
* **2 Corinthians 1.3-7** is about suffering and consolation (reflecting the experience of motherhood, perhaps).
* Alternatively, **Colossians 3.12-17** is about virtues such as compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, patience and love (relevant for motherhood, perhaps).
* **Luke 2.33-35** has Simeon saying to Mary, 'a sword will pierce your own soul too'.
* Alternatively, **John 19.25-27** has Jesus speaking to his mother from the cross.

## Lent 5

Year A

* **John 11.1-45** concludes the baptism-related series in John, and is about the dying and rising of Lazarus, which is related to baptism, and also looks ahead to Jesus' death and resurrection. **Ezekiel 37.1-14** is about God's breath (spirit) bringing dry bones to life. **Psalm 130** is about waiting for redemption: 'Out of the depths have I cried to you, O Lord'. **Romans 8.6-11** is about God giving life to mortal bodies through his Spirit.

## Palm Sunday

The lectionary assumes a 'Liturgy of the Palms' and a 'Liturgy of the Passion', each with its own reading from the Gospels and the Psalms (as in [_Times and Seasons_](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/times-and-seasons-2#mmm151)). But this is not mandatory, and it is not clear what should be done if there is no 'Liturgy of the Palms'. Presumably that part could simply be omitted. But the [RCL](http://www.commontexts.org/rcl/download/) describes an alternative: 'Those who do not observe the procession with palms and do not wish to use the passion gospel may substitute the gospel and psalm given for the Liturgy of the Passion with the gospel and psalm indicated for the Liturgy of the Palms. Whenever possible, the whole passion narrative should be read.'

**Liturgy of the Palms**

Year A

* **Matthew 21.1-11** is Matthew's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (branches are mentioned, but no palms specifically).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-29** [or 118.19-24] is about entering (the city) with joy, and says, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord', which is echoed in all four Gospel accounts ('hosanna' comes from 'save' in the previous verse).

Year B

* **Mark 11.1-11** is Mark's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (branches are mentioned, but no palms specifically).
* Alternatively, **John 12.12-16**  is John's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (and the only account to mention palm branches).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-24** [or 118.19-24] omits the verse about 'Blessed is he...' (see Year A), presumably for brevity, and therefore focuses on entering (the city) with joy.

Year C

* **Luke 19.28-40** is Luke's account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (no palms or branches are mentioned).
* **Psalm 118.1-2, 19-29** [or 118.19-24]: see Year A.

**Liturgy of the Passion**

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the Gospel reading.

* Alternatively, **Luke 23.1-49** begins with Jesus' trial before Pilate and ends soon after Jesus' death.

## Monday of Holy Week

## Maundy Thursday

Years A, B and C

* **Exodus 12.1-4 [5-10], 11-14** is the institution of the Passover.
* **Psalm 116.1, 10-17** (EV: 1-2, 12-19) [or 116.9-17 (EV: 10-19)] says, 'I will lift up the cup of salvation'.

# Easter {#easter}

A reading from Acts is included at every service between Easter Day and Pentecost, and it 'must be used as either the first or second reading'.

Gospel readings between Easter Day and Pentecost are exclusively from John's Gospel (continuing to Trinity Sunday in Years B and C), except on Easter 3 in Years A and B, on Ascension Day, and except for the alternative readings for Easter Day (which duplicate those for the Easter Vigil). Furthermore, on Easter 5, 6 and 7 (and on Pentecost in Years B and C, and Trinity in Year C), the readings are from the 'farewell discourse' (John 13-17).

## Easter Vigil

The readings are the same for Years A, B and C, except for the Gospel reading. 'A minimum of three Old Testament readings should be chosen. The reading from Exodus 14 should always be used.'

* **Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.4a** picks up on Easter and baptismal themes of (new) creation out of water, new life, and light out of darkness. **Psalm 136.1-9, 23-26** praises God as Creator.
* **Genesis 7.1-5, 11-18; 8.6-18; 9.8-13** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 4, spread over three weeks in Year A, Easter 4-6), picks up on the resurrection of Jesus being like passing through the waters of the flood. The dove points towards the gift of the Spirit at Pentecost. **Psalm 46** is about God as a refuge, 'Though the waters rage and swell'.
* **Genesis 22.1-18** (also the alternative _alternative_ first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) is about Abraham's beloved son Isaac being taken to the point of death and rescued. **Psalm 16** says, 'Preserve me, O God,' and 'you will not abandon my soul to Death'.
* **Exodus 14.10-31; 15.20, 21** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 2) draws on the connection between Israel passing through the Red Sea and Jesus passing through death to new life. The canticle **Exodus 15.1b-13, 17, 18** continues the theme.
* **Isaiah 55.1-11** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year B) picks up on baptismal themes: 'come to the waters', and 'as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth ...'. The canticle **Isaiah 12.2-6** says, 'With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.'
* **Baruch 3.9-15, 32 &ndash; 4.4** (from the Apocrypha, also the alternative first reading for Easter 5, Years B and C) is about wisdom, perhaps picking up on the Easter theme of newness of life. (Alternatively, **Proverbs 8.1-8, 19-21; 9.4b-6** is also about wisdom.) **Psalm 19** says, 'the testimony of the Lord ... gives wisdom to the simple'.
* **Ezekiel 36.24-28** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 7) says to a people in exile, 'I will sprinkle clean water upon you,' and 'I will put my spirit within you'. **Psalms 42, 43** expresses longing for God.
* **Ezekiel 37.1-14** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 6, Year C, and Pentecost, Year B, and the Old Testament reading for Lent 5, Year A) is about God's breath (spirit) bringing dry bones to life. **Psalm 143** speaks about being made to 'sit in darkness like those long dead', and says, 'Revive me, O Lord'.
* **Zephaniah 3.14-20** (also the alternative first reading for Easter 3) rejoices in God's salvation, and in fortunes being restored. **Psalm 98** rejoices in God's salvation.
* **Romans 6.3-11** connects baptism with the death and resurrection of Jesus. **Psalm 114** connects this with Israel coming out of Egypt and crossing the Jordan.

Year A

* **Matthew 28.1-10** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Matthew's account of the discovery of the empty tomb, and the appearance of the risen Jesus to the women.

Year B

* **Mark 16.1-8** (also the alternative Gospel reading for Easter Day) is Mark's account of the discovery of the empty tomb.

* **Psalm 118.1-2, 14-24** [or 118.14-24] draws on the same psalm as last week, and reflects the theme of resurrection: 'I shall not die, but live ... The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone'.

* **John 14.23-29** continues the series in John's 'farewell discourse', looking ahead to the gift of the Spirit.

## Trinity Sunday

Falls between 17 May and 20 June.

Year A

(RCL has Genesis 1.1 &ndash; 2.4a as the first reading, which then serves as the beginning of a series in Genesis. See 2 before Lent, which includes this passage as the Old Testament reading.)

* **Isaiah 40.12-17, 27-31** says, 'Who has directed the spirit of the Lord ...?' Is the answer, 'Jesus'? Otherwise, the connection with Trinity Sunday is not immediately obvious.
* **Psalm 8** (Years A and C) is about God's glory being revealed in creation and redemption (this finds its climax when God is revealed as Trinity), and is about God's 'name' (cf. Matthew 28.19: 'in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit').
* **2 Corinthians 13.11-13** refers to the Trinity: 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.'
* **Matthew 28.16-20** says, 'Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'.

(See also the alternative first readings for Easter 4-6.) **Psalm 46** says, 'Therefore we will not fear, though ... the waters rage and swell'.

* **Matthew 7.21-29** continues the series in Matthew (from 2 before Lent), on the theme of hearing and doing, with the house on rock or sand, and the floods coming. (If the reading is extended to begin at verse 16, this would restore to the lectionary some important sayings that are omitted by Common Worship: see RCL 'Proper 3' and Luke 6.43-44.) The 'Related' reading, **Deuteronomy 11.18-21, 26-28**, is about blessing following obedience, and curse following disobedience. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 31.1-5, 19-24** [or 31.19-24] mentions God being a 'strong rock', and speaks of the blessings that come from fearing God.

Year C

* **Matthew 9.9-13, 18-26** continues the series in Matthew, and is about Jesus calling Matthew and eating with 'tax-collectors and sinners', and then about Jesus restoring a girl to life and healing a woman. (The gap in the reading could be filled to include material that is otherwise omitted from the lectionary.) The 'Related' reading, **Hosea 5.15 &ndash; 6.6**, says, 'I desire steadfast love [mercy] and not sacrifice', which is quoted in the Gospel reading. The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 50.7-15**, has God testifying against Israel, despite their sacrifices.

Year C

* **1 Kings 17.8-16 [17-24]** continues the series on the prophets and in 1 and 2 Kings (out of sequence, presumably to give some connections with the Gospel reading), and tells of Elijah providing for the widow in Zaraphath [and raising her son: see the Gospel reading]. **Psalm 146** rejoices in the Lord's provision for the orphan and widow.

The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 89.1-4, 15-18** (or 89.8-18) says, 'in your favour you lift up our heads', which might be a prophet's reward.

Year C

* **2 Kings 2.1-2, 6-14** continues the series on the prophets and in 1 and 2 Kings, and is about Elijah being taken into heaven and the water dividing before Elijah and Elisha.

The 'Related' reading, **Zechariah 9.9-12** is about Zion's king coming in humility.

The 'Related' psalm, **Psalm 84.1-7** (EV: 1-8), expresses a desire 'to enter the courts of the Lord', and asks God to 'hear my prayer'.

## 4 before Advent (between 30 October and 5 November)*

(RCL 'Proper 26'.)

Displaced if All Saints' Day falls (or is celebrated) on a Sunday.

Year A

* The alternative psalm, **Psalm 107.1-8**, is derived from the RCL, which has a 'Continuous' Old Testament reading from Joshua 3.7-17, about the crossing of the Jordan, followed by Psalm 107.1-7, 33-37, which says, 'The Lord turns rivers into wilderness' (33).
* **1 Thessalonians 2.9-13** continues the series in 1 Thessalonians (without a gap), and is about how both Paul and the word of God worked among the believers.
* **Matthew 24.1-14** continues the series in Matthew, and is about 'the sign of [Jesus'] coming and of the end of the age'. (RCL has Matthew 23.1-12, which fits less well with the themes of the Sundays before Advent, but the change leaves a gap in the lectionary provision.) **Micah 3.5-12** is the related reading for the RCL reading, Matthew 23.1-12, pronouncing judgment on the prophets and rulers, but it also fits with Matthew 24.1-14, declaring that 'Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins'. **Psalm 43** calls out for deliverance 'from the deceitful and the wicked'.

Year C

* **2 Thessalonians 1.1-12** begins a three-week series in 2 Thessalonians. Paul looks ahead to the coming of Jesus.
* **Luke 19.1-10** continues the series in Luke, with Zacchaeus the repentant and forgiven tax-collector. **Isaiah 1.10-18** is a call to repentance and to seek justice, with a promise of forgiveness. **Psalm 32.1-8** (EV: 1-7) is about repentance and forgiveness.

## 3 before Advent (between 6 and 12 November)

(RCL 'Proper 27'.)

Usually Remembrance Sunday (the Sunday between 8 and 14 November).

Year A

* **1 Thessalonians 4.13-18** continues the series in 1 Thessalonians, and is about 'the coming of the Lord'.
* **Matthew 25.1-13** continues the series in Matthew, and is the parable of the ten bridesmaids (five foolish and five wise). **Wisdom of Solomon 6.12-16** (from the Apocrypha) is about wisdom, and is continued in the canticle, **Wisdom of Solomon 6.17-20**. Alternatively, **Amos 5.18-24**, is a warning (to the foolish) that 'the day of the Lord' will be 'darkness, not light', whereas **Psalm 70** echoes the longing of the wise bridesmaids for the coming of the bridegroom: 'O Lord, do not delay'.

Year B

The Old Testament, Psalm and Gospel are transferred from RCL Epiphany 3.

* **Mark 1.14-20** (Mark 12.38-44 in RCL).

Year C

* **2 Thessalonians 2.1-5, 13-17** continues the series in 2 Thessalonians, with more on the coming of Jesus.
* **Luke 20.27-38** continues the series in Luke, and picks up the end-times emphasis of the Sundays before Advent, with Jesus and the Sadducees discussing the resurrection and marriage. **Job 19.23-27a** contains a glimpse of resurrection hope. **Psalm 17.1-9** [or 17.1-8] follows Job in pleading integrity before God.

## 2 before Advent (between 13 and 19 November)

(RCL 'Proper 28'.)

Sometimes Remembrance Sunday (the Sunday between 8 and 14 November).

Year A

* **1 Thessalonians 5.1-11** concludes the series in 1 Thessalonians (continuing without a gap), and is about 'the day of the Lord'. (The series could be concluded a few weeks later, in Advent 3, Year A, with 1 Thessalonians 5.16-24.)
* **Matthew 25.14-30** continues the series in Matthew (without a gap), and is the parable of the talents, concluding with a warning of judgment. **Zephaniah 1.7, 12-18** is about the day of the Lord: 'Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them'. **Psalm 90.1-8 [9-11] 12** [or 90.1-8] says, 'You have set our misdeeds before you and our secret sins in the light of your countenance.'

Year C

* **2 Thessalonians 3.6-13** concludes the series in 2 Thessalonians, with a warning against idleness.
* **Luke 21.5-19** continues the series in Luke, and continues the end-times emphasis of the Sundays before Advent, with Jesus speaking about the destruction of the temple and the signs of the end times. **Malachi 4.1-2a** looks ahead to a day of destruction. **Psalm 98** says that the Lord 'comes to judge the earth'.

## Christ the King: 1 before Advent (between 20 and 26 November)

(RCL 'Proper 29'.)

Year A

* **Ephesians 1.15-23** says that God has put all things under Christ's feet.
* **Matthew 25.31-46** concludes the series in Matthew (continuing without a gap), and is about the 'Son of Man' on his throne separating the 'sheep' from the 'goats'. **Ezekiel 34.11-16, 20-24** is about God's care for his sheep: 'I will judge between sheep and sheep'. **Psalm 95.1-7** (EV: 1-7a) says, 'we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand'.

Year C

* **Jeremiah 23.1-6** (see BCP) says that God will raise up 'a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king'.
* **Psalm 46** has God reigning over the nations, causing wars to cease.
* **Colossians 1.11-20** is about 'the kingdom of [God's] beloved Son', in whom all things in heaven and on earth hold together.
* **Luke 23.33-43** concludes the series in Luke, with an extract from the Passion narrative (set for Palm Sunday). One of the crucified criminals acknowledges Christ as King.

# Festivals {#festivals}

According to the [Rules], Festivals are 'not usually displaced'. However,

> Festivals falling on a Sunday are to be kept on that day or transferred to the Monday (or, at the discretion of the minister, to the next suitable weekday). But a Festival may not be celebrated on Sundays in Advent, Lent or Eastertide. Festivals coinciding with a Principal Feast or Principal Holy Day are transferred to the first available day.

One of these Festivals might be the Patronal or Dedication Festival, which can be observed either as a Festival or as a Principal Feast. According to the [Rules],

> When kept as Principal Feasts, the Patronal and Dedication Festivals may be transferred to the nearest Sunday, unless that day is already a Principal Feast or one of the following days: the First Sunday of Advent, the Baptism of Christ, the First Sunday of Lent, the Fifth Sunday of Lent or Palm Sunday.

If it falls on one of those days, it must be transferred.

## The Naming and Circumcision of Jesus (1 January)

If Jesus was born on 25 December, he was circumcised on 1 January.

* **Numbers 6.22-27** connects the Aaronic blessing with the Lord's name: 'So they shall put my name on the Israelites'.
* **Psalm 8** says to the Lord, 'how glorious is your name'.
* **Galatians 4.4-7** says that Jesus was 'born under the law', which explains why he was circumcised.
* **Luke 2.15-21** (see BCP) says, 'After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.'

## The Conversion of Paul (25 January)

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Conversion of Paul ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **Jeremiah 1.4-10** is about Jeremiah's call as 'a prophet to the nations'. (See below for the alternative, **Acts 9.1-22**.)
* **Psalm 67** says, 'let all the peoples praise you'.
* **Acts 9.1-22** (see BCP) is the account of Saul/Paul's experience on the road to Damascus, in which the Lord says of him, 'he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles'.
* Alternatively, the passage from Acts can be the first reading, with **Galatians 1.11-16a** as the second reading, in which Paul says that God 'was pleased to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles'.
* **Matthew 19.27-30** (see BCP) is Jesus' promise to those who have 'left everything and followed [him]', which is the essence of conversion.

## Joseph of Nazareth (19 March)

19 March always falls during Lent. According to the [Rules],

> When St Joseph’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter or, if the Annunciation has already been moved to that date, to the first available day thereafter.

* **2 Samuel 7.4-16** is God's message to David, saying of David's son, 'I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.'
* **Psalm 89.26-36** has God saying of David, 'He shall call to me, "You are my Father,"' and 'His seed shall endure for ever'.
* **Romans 4.13-18** moves (apparently) from the idea of Jesus being treated as Joseph's son, to the idea of believers being treated as descendants of Abraham.
* **Matthew 1.18-25** is about Joseph, who 'took [Mary] as his wife', and 'named [her son] Jesus'.

## The Annunciation of Our Lord to the Blessed Virgin Mary (25 March)

This is a Principal Feast, but it comes across as somewhat unwanted, as it is never celebrated on a Sunday. 25 March always fall during Lent, or very occasionally on or just after Easter Day. According to the [Rules],

> the Annunciation, falling on a Sunday, is transferred to the Monday following or, falling between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.

* **Isaiah 7.10-14** says, 'Look, the young woman [Gk _the virgin_] is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.'
* **Psalm 40.5-11** (EV: 5-10) reflects Mary's response: 'In the scroll of the book it is written of me that I should do your will, O my God; I delight to do it: your law is within my heart.'
* **Hebrews 10.4-10** quotes Psalm 40 in relation to Jesus: 'Then I said, "See, God, I have come to do your will, O God" (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).'
* **Luke 1.26-38** (see BCP) is about the visit of Gabriel to Mary: 'you will conceive in your womb and bear a son', concluding with Mary saying, 'Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.'

## George, Martyr, Patron of England (23 April)

23 April always falls during or just before Easter season (Easter always falls between 22 March and 25 April), so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast). According to the [Rules],

> When St George’s Day or St Mark’s Day falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter. If both fall in this period, St George’s Day is transferred to the Monday and St Mark’s Day to the Tuesday.

## Mark the Evangelist (25 April)

25 April always falls during Easter season, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast). See above on George (23 April).

* **Proverbs 15.28-33** or **Acts 15.35-41**
* **Psalm 119.9-16**
* **Ephesians 4.7-16** (see BCP)
* **Mark 13.5-13**

## Philip and James, Apostles (1 May)

1 May always falls during Easter season, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

* **Isaiah 30.15-21**
* **Psalm 119.1-8**
* **Ephesians 1.3-10**
* **John 14.1-14** (see BCP)

## Matthias the Apostle (14 May)

14 May always falls between Easter and Trinity, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of Matthias ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **Isaiah 22.15-25**
* **Psalm 15**
* **Acts 1.15-26** (see BCP)
* **John 15.9-17**

## The Visit of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Elizabeth (31 May)

31 May usually falls between Easter and Trinity, so this Festival can rarely be celebrated on a Sunday (unless it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

## Barnabas the Apostle (11 June)

11 June occasionally falls before Trinity (20 June at the latest).

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... Barnabas ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **Job 29.11-16** or **Acts 11.19-30** (see BCP)

* **Ephesians 2.19-22** (see BCP)
* **John 20.24-29** (see BCP)

## Mary Magdalene (22 July)

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... James ..., the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **Jeremiah 45.1-5** or **Acts 11.27 &ndash; 12.2** (see BCP)
* **Psalm 126**
* **Acts 11.27 &ndash; 12.2** (see BCP) or **2 Corinthians 4.7-15**
* **Matthew 20.20-28** (see BCP)

## The Transfiguration of Our Lord (6 August)

## The Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August)

## Bartholomew the Apostle (24 August)

* **Isaiah 43.8-13** or **Acts 5.12-16** (see BCP)
* **Psalm 145.1-7**
* **Acts 5.12-16** (see BCP) or **1 Corinthians 4.9-15**
* **Luke 22.24-30** (see BCP)

## Holy Cross Day (14 September)

This is also known as the Feast of the 'Exaltation of the Cross', and has its origins in more than one event associated with the cross and Jerusalem. The theme of exaltation is reflected in the readings.

* **Psalm 22.23-28** expresses praise to the Lord, who 'has not despised nor abhorred the suffering of the poor', which fits with the theme of the crucified one being exalted.
* **Philippians 2.6-11** is about Christ humbling himself to 'death on a cross' and subsequently being exalted.
* **John 3.13-17** is about the Son of Man being 'lifted up', 'just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness'. **Numbers 21.4-9** is about the bronze serpent.

## Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist (21 September)

Matthew was a tax-collector. This is reflected in the readings.

* **Proverbs 3.13-18** says that wisdom is better than silver and gold.
* **Psalm 119.65-72** says that God's law is 'dearer to me than a hoard of gold and silver'.
* **2 Corinthians 4.1-6** (see BCP) has several possible connections with Matthew: renouncing 'shameful things', the 'open statement of the truth' (in writing his Gospel), light shining into Matthew's heart.
* **Matthew 9.9-13** (see BCP) tells of Jesus calling Matthew the tax-collector to follow him, and of Jesus eating with 'tax-collectors and sinners'.

## Michael and All Angels (29 September)

Michael the archangel is mentioned four times in Scripture: Daniel 10.13-21 and 12.1, Jude 9 and Revelation 12.7.

* **Genesis 28.10-17** is Jacob's dream of a 'ladder' with 'the angels of God ... ascending and descending on it', which is echoed in the Gospel reading.
* (See below for the alternative, **Revelation 12.7-12**.)
* **Psalm 103.19-22** says, 'Bless the Lord, you angels of his'.
* **Revelation 12.7-12** (see BCP) is about 'Michael and his angels' fighting against 'the dragon ... and his angels'.
* Alternatively, the passage from Revelation can be the first reading, with **Hebrews 1.5-14** as the second reading, contrasting angels with the Son: see 1.1-4 and 2.1-4.)
* **John 1.47-51** has Jesus saying to Nathanael, 'you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man', echoing the Old Testament reading.

## Luke the Evangelist (18 October)

Luke was a 'physician' (Colossians 4.14). This is reflected in the readings. (Elsewhere, Luke is mentioned by name only in 2 Timothy 4.11 and Philemon 24.)

* **Isaiah 35.3-6** is about the restoration of health.
* Alternatively, **Acts 16.6-12a** contains the first 'we' of the narrative, subtly indicating the point at which Luke joined Paul and his companions.
* **Psalm 147.1-7** says that the Lord 'heals the brokenhearted and binds up all their wounds'.
* **2 Timothy 4.5-17** (see BCP) says, 'Only Luke is with me.'
* **Luke 10.1-9** (see BCP) is about the mission of the seventy, which perhaps speaks more directly to those (such as Luke) who are not numbered among the Twelve. (Luke has at times been numbered among the [seventy disciples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_disciples).) They were sent out to 'cure the sick' and to speak of the 'kingdom of God', which is appropriate to Luke as a physician and the author of one of the Gospels.

## Simon and Jude, Apostles (28 October)

Simon, one of the Twelve (not Peter), appears as 'the Cananaean' in Matthew 10.4 and Mark 3.18, and as 'the Zealot' in Luke 6.15 and Acts 1.13.

Jude, one of the Twelve, is mentioned as 'Judas son of James' in Luke 6.16 and Acts 1.13, as 'Judas (not Iscariot)' when he asks a question in John 14.22, and (presumably) as 'Thaddaeus' (or 'Lebbaeus') in Matthew 10.3 and as 'Thaddaeus' in Mark 3.18. The Greek behind 'son of James' is simply 'of James', which has historically led many (especially in the West) to identify this Jude with the author of the Epistle of Jude (who describes himself as 'Jude ... brother of James'), who is identified with 'Judas', a brother of Jesus, mentioned in Matthew 13.55 and Mark 6.3.

According to tradition, Simon and Jude worked together as evangelists and were martyred together.

* **Ephesians 2.19-22** speaks of the church as being 'built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone'. **Isaiah 28.14-16** has God speaking of 'a foundation stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation'. **Psalm 119.89-96** reflects the theme of foundations: the Lord's word 'stands firm', the Lord has 'established the earth', and the Lord's 'judgements stand firm'.
* **John 15.17-27** (see BCP) reflects Simon and Jude's calling, by speaking of persecution and of Jesus' command to his disciples to 'testify'.

## Andrew the Apostle (30 November)

30 November, if it is a Sunday, falls on the First Sunday of Advent, so this Festival is never celebrated on a Sunday (not even if it is the Patronal Festival celebrated as a Principal Feast).

'In the Anglican Communion, St Andrewstide is widely observed by intercessions for foreign missions.'[^Andrew] This is the emphasis in the readings.

* **Romans 10.12-18** (see BCP) is about the good news being proclaimed 'to all the earth', echoing Jesus' call to Andrew. The other two readings are quoted: **Isaiah 52.7-10** ('How beautiful ... are the feet') and **Psalm 19.1-6** ('... their words to the ends of the world').
* **Matthew 4.18-22** (see BCP) has Jesus calling two pairs of brothers as his first followers: Simon Peter and Andrew, followed by James and John. To the first pair, Jesus says, 'Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.'

## Stephen, Deacon, First Martyr (26 December)

According to rule 6 at the top of the [lectionary](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/lectionary#p539a),

> If there are only two readings at the principal service on ... the Festivals of ... Stephen, the reading from the Acts of the Apostles must always be used.

* **2 Chronicles 24.20-22** is about the stoning of Zechariah (who said as he was dying, 'May the Lord see and avenge!').
* (See below for the alternative, **Acts 7.51-60**.)
* **Psalm 119.161-168** speaks of being 'persecuted ... without a cause'.
* **Acts 7.51-60** (see BCP) is about the stoning of Stephen (who said as he was dying, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them').
* Alternatively, the passage from Acts can be the first reading, with **Galatians 2.16b-20** as the second reading, which speaks of having been 'crucified with Christ'.
* **Matthew 10.17-22** warns of being 'put to death' because of Jesus.

## John, Apostle and Evangelist (27 December)

John the Apostle (son of Zebedee) is traditionally identified with the evangelist who wrote 'John's Gospel', with the author of the 'Letters of John', and with the author of the Book of Revelation.

* **Psalm 117** may have been chosen because John's testimony was for all nations.
* **1 John 1** (see BCP) is about John's eyewitness testimony.
* **John 21.19b-25** (see BCP) says that 'the disciple whom Jesus loved', 'the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper', was the one who wrote this Gospel. **Exodus 33.7-11a** speaks of a similarly close relationship: 'the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend'.

## The Holy Innocents (28 December)

The infants of Bethlehem are often celebrated as martyrs, and this may be reflected in the readings.

* **Psalm 124** speaks of having 'escaped', as the infant Jesus (and the other infants?) escaped from Herod.
* **1 Corinthians 1.26-29** speaks of God choosing 'what is weak in the world to shame the strong', inviting a contrast between the infant Jesus (and the other infants?) and Herod.
* **Matthew 2.13-18** (see BCP) says that Herod 'killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under'. **Jeremiah 31.15-17** is quoted: 'Rachel weeping for her children'.

## Dedication Festival

Year A

* **1 Kings 8.22-30** is Solomon's prayer of dedication for the temple.
* Alternatively, **Revelation 21.9-14** speaks of the walls and gates of the 'holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God'.

* **Hebrews 12.18-24** says that believers 'have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem'.
* **Matthew 21.12-16** says that Jesus 'drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple'.

Year B

* Alternatively, **Revelation 21.9-14**: see Year A.
* **Psalm 122**: see Year A.
* **1 Peter 2.1-10** likens believers to 'living stones', being built into a spiritual house'.
* **John 10.22-29** is set in Jerusalem at the time of 'the festival of the Dedication'.

Year C

* **1 Chronicles 29.6-19** has David praising God when the people make offerings for the construction of the temple.
* **Psalm 122**: see Year A.
* **Ephesians 2.19-22** speaks of believers growing into 'a holy temple in the Lord'.
* **John 2.13-22** speaks of Jesus driving people out of the temple and saying, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.'

## Harvest Thanksgiving

Year A

* **Deuteronomy 8.7-18** speaks of God bringing his people into a fruitful land, and warns against forgetting God in times of plenty.
* Alternatively, **Deuteronomy 28.1-14** speaks of the blessings that follow from obedience.

## John (Years A, B and C)

Every year is a 'John year', at least from Christmas to Pentecost (or Trinity), during which the Gospel reading is very often taken from John. Most (73%) of John is covered, with the biggest omissions in chapters 7, 8 and 16. The only readings from John in Ordinary Time are from chapter 6 in Year B (Proper 12 to 16). Each year includes readings taken from the following chapters (more or less):

* Christmas and Epiphany: chapters 1 and 2
* Ash Wednesday: chapter 8 (one alternative)
* Lent (2), 3, 4 (Years A and B): chapters 2, 3, 4 and 9
* Lent 5: chapters 11 and 12
* Holy Week: chapters 12 and 13
* Good Friday: chapters 18 and 19
* Easter Day and Easter 2: chapter 20 (and Easter 3, Year C, chapter 21)
* Easter 4: chapter 10
