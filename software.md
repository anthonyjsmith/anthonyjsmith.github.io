title: Software
excerpt: I spent almost five years working on software for the Herschel Space Observatory, followed by three years on various web-based projects with Ruby on Rails.

From the summer of 2013 to the summer of 2016, I worked on various web-based projects using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

From October 2008 until June 2013 I developed some software (Java/Jython) for the [Herschel Space Observatory](http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=16), which was launched in May 2009. One of my main responsibilities was to implement advanced methods of point source extraction for use on data from the [PACS](http://pacs.ster.kuleuven.ac.be/) and [SPIRE](http://www.spire.rl.ac.uk/) instruments on Herschel. I was doing this work first as a Research Fellow in Astronomy at Sussex University until July 2012, and since August 2012 I was working as a consultant with [Blue Sky Spectroscopy](http://blueskyspectroscopy.com/), working on the software for the spectrometer on SPIRE.
