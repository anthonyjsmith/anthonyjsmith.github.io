<p>Right, I'm going to do something very countercultural, so hold tight. No, don't worry, I'm not going to leave Facebook or switch my mobile phone off. More radical than that: I'm going to tell you how I'm planning to vote in the next election.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Pavilion_(UK_Parliament_constituency)">Brighton Pavilion constituency</a>, in which I live, is a <a href="/2010/02/05/brighton-going-green/">three-way marginal between the Labour, Conservative and Green parties</a>. I'm backing the <a href="http://www.greenparty.org.uk/">Green Party</a> candidate. Here's why.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like many, I find myself disillusioned with Labour and the Conservatives. Nothing excites me less than another parliamentary term under one or the other. I want to see real change, and for me that means a hung parliament after the next election, with greater representation for the smaller parties, and a gradual shift of power away from the Lab-Con establishment (or, more likely, a serious reform of one or both of those parties).</li>
<li>The Green Party is a significant force in British politics, with <a href="http://www.greenparty.org.uk/about.html">numerous Green councillors and two Green MEPs</a>. However, of the 646 seats in the Commons, not one is occupied by a Green Party representative. This is a consequence of our <a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/">silly</a> "first-past-the-post" voting system. Now, even though I don't agree with all of their policies, I'm not a Green Party member, and I don't think I'd want a Green Government, I do want there to be a Green voice in the Commons. That can happen only if they get a majority of the votes in at least one constituency. Brighton Pavilion is their best chance yet, and a <a href="http://www.carolinelucas.com/cl/why/winning.html">very realistic chance</a> at that.</li>
<li>There are many things I like about the Green Party. I've been very impressed with the <a href="http://www.brightonhovegreens.org/localsites/bh.html">local party</a>, its members and councillors, and think they are doing a great job at making Brighton a better place. There's a certain freshness, authenticity and transparency to the way the party functions. Their policies are much wider than environmental issues and I like the sound of a lot of them (for example, they don't idolize the free market economy).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.carolinelucas.com/">Caroline Lucas MEP</a>, the party leader and their candidate for Brighton Pavilion, has been on the BBC twice this week, and has confirmed what I thought already, that she is an able, intelligent and articulate politician with great integrity. But you can judge for yourself: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00rmvy6/Question_Time_Wythenshawe/">Question Time</a> (available for ages), and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00rpwns/Straight_Talk_Caroline_Lucas_MEP_Green_Party_Leader/">Straight Talk</a> (available for the next few days).</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, enough of this crazy political stuff...</p>
