title: 'Bishop of Chester: separation between legal and religious sides of marriage'

<p><a href="http://www.chester.anglican.org/who_list.asp">The Bishop of Chester, Peter Forster</a>, <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000071">speaking in yesterday's debate in the House of Lords</a> (emphases added):</p>
<blockquote><p>How should we proceed? I have come to the view that a more radical reconstruction of the law on marriage would be the right way forward. I think it would meet a lot of the issues raised in the powerful speeches that have been made. We should consider going some way towards the <strong>continental version</strong>, which has <strong>a legal, contractual relationship that is the same for everyone</strong>, absolutely without question. Then we could develop <strong>different religious understandings on top of that</strong>. That may be a bridge too far: the Government thought so when they drew up this rather rushed legislation. Several Members in the other place drew attention to this as the logical outcome of what we should be doing. Much of what we have heard today would potentially be satisfied, amid our societyâ€™s many differences, if we <strong>separated the legal contract of marriage, which the state establishes as being the same for everyone, and the religious side</strong>. I fully accept that that would have implications for establishment but there are unintended consequences of this Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Dear, said, and that is just one of them. It has not been thought out and if we commit this Bill to a Committee, we are almost saying that the Bill can be improved by tinkering: it cannot. What is wrong with it is just too basic. That is why, with the same regrets that the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, mentioned, I shall be with the noble Lord, Lord Dear, in the Division Lobby.</p></blockquote>
<p>See my various posts on marriage for some arguments along similar lines.</p>
<p>I think that last bit means he'll be voting <del>against the bill</del> in favour of Lord Dear's <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000338">amendment</a>, which would effectively wreck the bill. I don't think it means he regrets having to share a (cramped?) lobby with Lord Dear.</p>
