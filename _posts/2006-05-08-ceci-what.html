<p>For those of you still in the dark, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte">René Magritte</a>, a Beligan surrealist artist, painted <em>La trahison des images (The Treachery Of Images)</em> in the 1920s.  Underneath a picture of a pipe he painted the words, <em>Ceci n'est pas une pipe (This is not a pipe)</em>.</p>
<p>I became familiar with this work not through my extensive knowledge of Belgian art, but through the quite remarkable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%2C_Escher%2C_Bach"><em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</em></a> by Douglas Hofstadter. Why not order a copy now instead of reading blogs?<strong><br />
