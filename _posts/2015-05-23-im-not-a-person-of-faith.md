There are two types of people: normal people, and everyone else.

How you unpack that depends on what you think of as normal.

So there are Brits and foreigners. Or Jews and Gentiles. Or (ancient) Greeks and barbarians. Or Muslims and non-Muslims. Or Christians and non-Christians.

The important thing to note is that people in the 'everyone else' category never identify themselves by that label. No one would say, simply, 'I'm a foreigner,' except to say, 'From the perspective of a Brit, I'm a foreigner.'

So what about 'person of faith'?

This is the term for everyone else, if to be normal is to be secular, or 'non-religious' (put in quotes, because 'religious' is itself another of those 'everyone else' terms).

So there are two types of people: normal, secular people, and people of faith.

From the perspective of a secular, 'non-religious' person, I'm a person of faith.

But, from my own perspective, I'm not a person of faith. I'm a Christian.
