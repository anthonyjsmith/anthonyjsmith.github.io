<p>It's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6048392.stm">official</a>: today, Tuesday the 17th of October, 2006, is an "ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance".  Bloggers are being urged on this "run-of-the-mill day" to record for posterity all the insignificant details of their boring lives. Historians in the year 3006 will be fascinated by this.</p>
