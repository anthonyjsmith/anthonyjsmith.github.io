I've just finished reading [Bede's _Ecclesiastical History of the English People_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/260903/ecclesiastical-history-of-the-english-people-by-bede/), so it was interesting to listen to Stephen Cottrell, the new Archbishop of York, [speaking about Cedd and the Synod of Whitby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySjCq8JTvCY).

The disagreements in AD 664 were profound: nothing less than the correct date for Easter, and the way monks should cut their hair! Cedd was on the losing side of the argument, but (1) the church made a clear decision, and (2) Cedd submitted to it.

Cedd, it seems, knew that the church needed to be shaped by [agreement]({% post_url 2014-07-18-on-good-disagreement-and-the-future-of-the-church-of-england %}), not by 'living together with our conscientiously held disagreements' (something which apparently didn't occur to the Synod of Whitby). May there be more Cedds today: people who help the church to make a clear decision on its significant points of disagreement in a timely manner, and who are willing to live in obedience to the church's teaching.
