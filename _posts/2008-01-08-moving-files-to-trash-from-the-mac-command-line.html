<p>Ever wished you could move files to the trash from the command line on the Mac? Here's how.</p>
<p>First, buy a Mac. Then</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Option 1 (uses bash): add the following to your ~/.bash_profile</p>
<pre lang="bash">function rem {
for b in "$@"
do
osascript -e "tell app \"Finder\" to delete POSIX file \"${PWD}/$b\""
done
}</pre>
<p>Then type 'source ~/.bash_profile' in Terminal.</p>
<p>Or Option 2 (uses Python and gives slightly more meaningful error messages): make an executable file called 'rem' somewhere in your $PATH:</p>
<pre lang="python">#! /usr/bin/python
import os
import sys
if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1:
    for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
        if os.path.exists(arg):
            os.system('osascript -e 
<p>Now, either way, to move 'blah.txt' to Trash, simply type 'rem blah.txt'. Wildcards and lists of files are permitted. You even get the sound effects!</p>
<p>(This makes use of Applescript and works for me on OS X Tiger and Leopard. Thanks to kw for pointing out the problem with Option 1 and leading me to think of an alternative - 3 July 2008. And thanks for icke for showing me how to make the bash version work all the time - 6 Nov 2008.)</p>
tell app "Finder" '
                      + 'to move the POSIX file "'
                      + os.path.abspath(arg) + '" to trash
<p>Now, either way, to move 'blah.txt' to Trash, simply type 'rem blah.txt'. Wildcards and lists of files are permitted. You even get the sound effects!</p>

        else:
            print "Error:", os.path.abspath(arg), "does not exist"
else:
    print "usage: rem file(s)"
    print "       move file(s) to Trash"</pre>
