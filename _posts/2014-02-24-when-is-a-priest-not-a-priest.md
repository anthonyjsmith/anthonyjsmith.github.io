Our English word _priest_ comes from the Latin word _presbyter_, which itself comes from the Greek word _presbuteros_. When this Greek word appears in the Bible, most English versions translate it _not_ as "priest", but as "elder".

However, the word _priest_ does still appear in English Bibles, but it is used to translate the Greek word _hiereus_ or the Hebrew word _kohen_ (compare the surname [Cohen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen_(surname))), with the Latin equivalent being _sacerdos_, from which we get the English word _sacerdotal_ ("priestly"). This kind of priest is not an elder, but is someone who offers sacrifices in a temple.

How did we end up in this linguistic mess?

It's fairly easy to see how "priest" would cease to be used as a translation of _presbyter_. By the time of the Reformation, a "priest" was seen as someone who had a special role in the mass, in which it was believed that the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ on the cross became a present reality as the bread and wine became the body and blood of Jesus. The Protestant Reformers were keen to distance themselves from this understanding of the Lord's Supper, and in due course they came to prefer not to use the word _priest_ to translate _presbuteros_. Thus, whereas [The Wycliffe Bible (c.1395) speaks of Paul and Barnabas appointing "priests" (or "prestis")](http://www.studylight.org/desk/index.cgi?q1=Acts+14:23&t1=en_wyc), from [Tyndale's translation (c.1525)](http://www.studylight.org/desk/index.cgi?q1=Acts+14:23&t1=en_tyn) onwards, Protestant translations almost always speak of them appointing "elders". Perhaps as a consequence of the King James Version not using "priest" as a translation of _presbuteros_, you will never find a "priest" in a Protestant English-speaking church — with perhaps one very obvious exception! Instead, you will find elders, ministers, pastors, presbyters and the like.

But how did "priest" gain a sacerdotal meaning in the first place? It turns out this happened very early on. According to David Allan Hubbard,

> The church's priesthood in the NT is corporate: no individual minister or leader is called 'priest'. The post-apostolic writings, however, move quickly in that direction: Clement (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ad</span> 95–96) describes Christian ministry in terms of high priest, priest and Levites ([_1 Clem_. 40–44](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ii.ii.xl.html)); [the _Didache_ (13:3)](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/richardson/fathers.viii.i.iii.html#viii.i.iii-p49) likens prophets to high priests. Tertullian ([_On Baptism_ 17](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.vi.iii.xvii.html)) and Hippolytus ([_Refutation of All Heresies_, preface](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf05.iii.iii.i.ii.html)) seemed to have pioneered the use of the titles 'priest' and 'high priest' for Christian ministers (_c_. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ad</span> 200) (_Priests and Levites_, in New Bible Dictionary, 3rd edition, IVP).

I suppose this was all linked with the church's developing ideas about the Lord's Supper.

So what about the exception I mentioned above? Of course, this is the Church of England, in which the "normal" word for an elder is _priest_. It seems that Cranmer didn't try to get rid of the word, given [its inclusion even in the 1549 _Book of Common Prayer_](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fjustus.anglican.org%2Fresources%2Fbcp%2F1549%2F+priest), and he clearly saw no problem in using the word _priest_ while [strongly](http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx#XXVIII) [denying](http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx#XXXI) the Roman Catholic understanding of the mass. Hence there is some justification in claiming that, in the Church of England, "priest" is just another word for "presbyter" or "elder".

In fact, this seems to have become official with the Ordinal from the _Alternative Service Book_ (1980), which speaks of "[The Ordination of Priests (also called Presbyters)](http://justus.anglican.org/~ss/commonworship/other/ordinal/priests.html)", and even more official in 2005, with the removal of the parentheses in the _Common Worship_ Ordinal, in which may be found "[The Ordination of Priests, also called Presbyters](http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/ordinal/priests.aspx)". In the text of this Ordinal, this "priests aren't actually priests" motif is perhaps emphasised still further by the inclusion of phrases such as "a royal priesthood, a universal Church", intended to emphasise the (sacerdotal) priesthood of the whole church, as opposed to the (presbyteral) priesthood of the newly-ordained "priests". But it really gets confusing when these two are put in close conjunction:

> And now we give you thanks<br />
> that you have called these your servants,<br />
> whom we ordain in your name,<br />
> to share as [presbyteral] priests in the ministry of the gospel of Christ,<br />
> the Apostle and High [sacerdotal] Priest of our faith,<br />
> and the Shepherd of our souls.

(These elements weren't present in the [1662 Ordinal](http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/the-form-and-manner-of-making,-ordaining-and-consecrating-of-bishops,-priests-and-deacons/the-ordering-of-priests.aspx).)

One could be forgiven for finding this disparity between ecclesiastical vocabulary (_presbuteros_ = "priest") and biblical vocabulary (_presbuteros_ = "elder") to be less than helpful! So it's no surprise that many in the Church of England (including most evangelicals) tend to avoid the _p_-word as much as possible.
