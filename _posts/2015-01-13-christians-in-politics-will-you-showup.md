In politics, it has been said, decisions are made by those who show up.

[<img alt="Christians in Politics" title="Christians in Politics" src="/assets/christians-in-politics.png" class="alignright" />Christians in Politics](http://www.christiansinpolitics.org.uk/) launched a new campaign today:

> [The Show Up campaign](http://www.christiansinpolitics.org.uk/showup/) aims to encourage positive Christian engagement in the run up to, and beyond, the 2015 General Election.

The launch video is below, and puts it very clearly:

> We have a choice as believers in the UK. Are we going to spend the next few years just commentating and complaining about the state of our country? Or are we going to follow the biblical precedent of people like Joseph, Esther and Daniel, who served in the midst of regimes that make present day politics look positively virtuous. Surely it's time for Christians to **Show Up**.

What could _you_ do, beyond just voting?
