American Bible teacher and author [Nancy Guthrie](http://www.nancyguthrie.com/) has a new book out: [_Even Better than Eden_](https://www.crossway.org/books/even-better-than-eden-tpb/). It looks fascinating, given her recent article on the Crossway website: ['10 Things You Should Know about the Garden of Eden'](https://www.crossway.org/articles/10-things-you-should-know-about-the-garden-of-eden/). And the 10 things are...

1. Eden was good, but not yet fully glorious.
1. Eden was abundant, but it wasn't yet expansive.
1. Eden was completely good, but it wasn't completely secure.
1. Eden had a rhythm of work and then rest, but not yet unending rest.
1. Adam and Eve were made in the image of God, but not yet as glorious as God intended.
1. Adam and Eve were naked, not yet robed in royal splendor.
1. Adam and Eve enjoyed one-flesh intimacy, but their bond was vulnerable to brokenness.
1. Adam and Eve enjoyed God's presence, but they were vulnerable to his presence in judgment.
1. Adam and Eve could have gained the knowledge of good and evil without eating from the forbidden tree.
1. Eden had the tree of life, but Adam and Eve were prohibited from eating from it.

Quite a refreshing way of thinking about it.

> From the very beginning, Eden was not meant to be static; it was headed somewhere. We could say there was an eschatology of Eden. God's intentions for his creation have always been headed toward consummation, toward glory. ...
>
> Sometimes we hear the story of the Bible told as Creation-Fall-Redemption-Restoration. But as good as Eden was, we're not merely headed back to Eden as it once was. The story of the Bible is Creation-Fall-Redemption-Consummation. We're looking forward to a home that will be even better than Eden.
