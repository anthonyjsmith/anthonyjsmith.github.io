I've been working on a commentary on the Common Worship Principal Service Lectionary, aiming to answer the question: _Why was this passage chosen?_

It's very much a work in progress, and will be for quite some time, but I'm currently a few weeks ahead of the game, so now is probably a good time to share it...

If someone else has already written something like this, I'd be delighted to know!
