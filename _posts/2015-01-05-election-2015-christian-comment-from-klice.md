The excellent [Kirby Laing Institute for Christian Ethics (KLICE)](http://klice.co.uk/) has a [new page devoted to the 2015 (general) election](http://klice.co.uk/index.php/resources/election2015).

You can read all about it in their recent _KLICE Comment_: [Beyond Pantomime Politics: KLICE pauses for thought before May 2015](http://tyndalehouse.createsend.com/t/ViewEmail/r/92E079557F585A102540EF23F30FEDED).

Here's the introduction from the page itself:

> KLICE is commissioning a range of thought-provoking election pieces between January and April 2015. These will provide serious theological reflections for readers as they prepare to engage with the election issues and reflect on how to vote. Our major offering is a special series of eight _Ethics in Brief_ on the main British political parties. These won't advise you how to vote but may help to think more critically about your political allegiance.

Make sure you [sign up for _KLICE Comment_](http://klice.co.uk/index.php/contact#klicenews) for email updates.
