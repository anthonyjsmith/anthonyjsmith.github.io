title: '321: the story of God, the world and you'
---
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://thelongwalkhome.co.uk/2012/09/11/something-nothing-can-change/">Kath</a> for pointing me to this great video summary of the Christian good news. Strikingly, it starts by explaining the Trinity. This is very refreshing. God isn't the angry perfectionist, but he is the Father, Son and Spirit, bound together by love. Also refreshing is the way that the world features in the summary. Regular readers might have noticed that I am not overjoyed when as Christians we forget about the world and think that <a title="Spiritual reductionism" href="/2012/05/08/spiritual-reductionism/">the only things that ultimately matter are God and human souls</a>. Not so in this summary: the story culminates with Christ's return to the world, with the dead being raised bodily, and with the world being set to rights.</p>
