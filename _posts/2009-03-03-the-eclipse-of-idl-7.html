<p>I've finally made the transition from <a href="http://www.ittvis.com/idl/">IDL</a> 6.4 to IDL 7. Here are my handy hints...</p>
<ul>
<li>IDL Workbench rocks! (This is because it is basically <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, which is a proper development environment, unlike that hideous old IDLDE.)</li>
<li>Another reason for using IDL Workbench (for me at least, and for now) is that IDL help doesn't seem to work if Java 6 is the default (as it is on my Mac), but the help <em>does</em> work if launched through the IDL Workbench.</li>
</ul>
<p>To transition to IDL Workbench:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your code as described on <a href="http://www.dfanning.com/workbench/setup_projects.html">David Fanning's page</a> - fret not, it's easy and harmless</li>
<li>Preferences -&gt; IDL -&gt; Startup file, if you have one, and</li>
<li>Preferences -&gt; IDL -&gt; Paths -&gt; Insert... for me it was just my idl folder, including all sub-folders, to mimic my $IDL_PATH environment variable.</li>
</ol>
