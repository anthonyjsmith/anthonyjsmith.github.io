<p>I seem to have found my way onto the letters page of this week's <em>Wirral Globe</em>. Here's the <a href="http://www.wirralglobe.co.uk/yoursay/wirralletters/10951596.Wind_power_debate_is_full_of_hot_air/">letter</a> (title is editorial):</p>
<p><strong>Wind power debate is full of hot air</strong></p>
<p>LAST week's Globe letters page contained two reminders of the power of wind.</p>
<p>First was <a href="http://www.wirralglobe.co.uk/yoursay/wirralletters/10920940.SNAPPED_BY_YOU__New_Brighton_storm/">Tom Lear's dramatic photo of the storms at New Brighton</a>, an example of the kind of extreme weather we can expect more of, the more carbon we pump into the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Second was the <a href="http://www.wirralglobe.co.uk/yoursay/wirralletters/10920859.Wind_farm_scam_continues/">letter</a> by <a href="http://ukipnw.org.uk/griffiths-becomes-president/">UKIP’s Philip Griffiths</a>, warning us about some plans to turn more of that wind power into electricity, through the construction of more offshore wind turbines.</p>
<p>It’s a matter of personal preference, of course, but given the choice, I’d rather see more of the latter than of the former.</p>
