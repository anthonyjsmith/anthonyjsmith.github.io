title: Advice to an archbishop
---
<p>So in a lecture <a title="The Archbishop of Canterbury's page" href="http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/1581">Rowan Williams</a>, admittedly in a display of <a title="Telegraph leader" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/02/08/dl0801.xml">"political ineptitude"</a>, makes some carefully reasoned and apparently reasonable (if obfuscatory) suggestions about how a single, unitary legal system (same laws for every citizen) might accommodate a diversity of religious and cultural practices on <a title="Archbishop's lecture" href="http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/1575">"certain carefully selected matters"</a>. Then what happens?</p>
<p>For a thoughtful analysis we can turn to <a href="http://davidpfield.blogspot.com/2008/02/meet-your-new-god.html">David Field</a>. Inane reactions are less difficult to find: <a title="The Sun" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article782629.ece">"Arch enemy: bash the bishop</a> ... in a damning You The Jury poll [b]y last night, 14,683 had called for his dismissal. Just 631 said he should  stay", <a title="Telegraph" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/09/nsharia109.xml">"barrage of criticism"</a>, <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/ukcorrespondents/holysmoke/feb08/rowanwilliamsauthority.htm">"fatuous remarks"</a>.</p>
<p>And we turn up our noses when <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/5349604.stm">some Muslims react violently to an academic lecture by the Pope</a>.</p>
<p>So my advice to Dr Williams, if he is reading, is this: keep it simple. If you can't make your point in half a dozen monosyllabic words, just don't say anything. Don't expect us to make an effort really to understand you. We won't. And be warned: if you get it wrong, we might form a mob and stone you (albeit <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article782700.ece">with sponges</a>).</p>
