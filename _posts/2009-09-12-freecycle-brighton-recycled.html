title: Freecycle Brighton recycled?
---
<p>I've been using Freecycle Brighton for a few years now. Since I <a href="/2006/12/29/freecycle/">blogged about it</a> in 2006, I've successfully used it to get rid of an upright piano, a table or two, a printer, an old drum kit, around 100 chairs, a fridge, a sofa and a few bookcases, as well as obtaining and subsequently getting rid of a bed or two. No idea how I managed to accumulate that much stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems that Freecycle has not been free from power-hungry leadership, and now the UK groups and moderators seem to be escaping from the heavy-handed control of the Freecycle overlord(s) in the USA.</p>
<p>Or that's the impression I get from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2009/sep/10/uk-freecycle-us-network">the report in the Guardian</a>, particularly the comments section. More on the <a href="http://freecycling.wordpress.com/">Freecycling blog</a> and on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Brighton_Freecycle_Cafe/">Brighton Freecycle Cafe group</a>...</p>
<p>FreecycleBrighton has worked spectacularly well, but it seems to have suffered a possibly serious blow. The Yahoo! group has been closed down by the moderators, and group members were directed to <a href="http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/GreenCycleSussex/">GreenCycleSussex</a> as the new group. At the last count, this has 494 members. But of the 16,000(?) former FreecycleBrighton members, those 3000 or so who signed up through the <a href="http://www.freecycle.org/group/UK/South%20East/Brighton">"official" Freecycle page</a> are still there, freecycling away, quite possibly unaware of all the rumblings that have taken place. And other groups are springing up, such as <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freebrighton/">freebrighton</a>.</p>
<p>Similar action is being taken by many UK Freecycle groups, reconvening under the name <a href="http://www.freegle.org.uk/">Freegle</a>.</p>
<p>All a bit of a mess really. I'm minded to go with the Green Cycle Sussex group for now, out of principle. But if that doesn't work out, then I might (very reluctantly) succumb to the official group, this time out of a different principle.</p>
<p><strong>Update 21 Sep 2009:</strong> the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freecyclebrighton/">Freecycle Brighton group page</a> (also available as <a href="http://www.freebrighton.org/">www.freebrighton.org</a>) now states explicitly that it is "no longer affiliated with the US freecycle network".</p>
<p><strong>Update 8 Oct 2009</strong>: following legal pressure from "The Freecycle Network (TM)", the Freecycle Brighton Yahoo! group has now been renamed <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freebrighton/">FreeBrighton</a>.</p>
