<p>This has to be one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen or heard - and we're doing part of it in the wonderful <a href="http://bremf.org.uk/">Brighton Early Music Festival (BREMF)</a>, in the "Four weddings and a funeral" concert one week today (Saturday 23 October)!</p>
<p>To quote a <a href="http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/609295?view=synopsis">British Film Institute description</a>: "Una Stravaganza dei Medici was devised for the marriage celebrations of Ferdinand de Medici and the French princess Christine of Lorraine in 1589. It tells five mythological stories through music, singing and dance, to music by Marenzio, Bardi, Cavalieri, Malvezzi, Peri and Caccini. This production uses the most advanced twentieth century technology to recreate the original spectacle. Performed by the Taverner Consort and Choir conducted by Andrew Parrott, this programme won the Special Prize at this year's Prix Italia."</p>
