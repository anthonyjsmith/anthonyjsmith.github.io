title: How to vote ethically
---
<p>I know nothing about politics. Okay, I know what I think about a few controversial moral issues, but the rest - the other 99% or so - is a complete mystery to me.</p>
<p>But I'm glad I'm not alone, as Joseph Bloggs demonstrates in this promotional video for the <a href="http://www.jubilee-centre.org/">Jubilee Centre</a>'s new book, <a href="http://www.jubilee-centre.org/resources.php?catID=2"><em>Votewise Now!</em></a></p>
