<p>The <a href="http://www.thebadgeronline.co.uk/news/7621/#more-7621">best café at Sussex University is facing closure</a>. Do <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-the-EngineeringRichmond-Cafe-The-Coffee-Workshop/339880018275">sign up to show your support</a>. However, I was intrigued by this comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a letter to Michael Farthing, one member of university staff wrote: “I feel that many people amongst the predominantly left-wing community at this university will be offended at the shutting down of a thriving independent café, to create a forced monopoly of institutional food with negative impacts on many people’s lives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What does "left-wing" mean in this context? Surely any true left-wingers should be entirely in favour of enforced state ownership and equality (of outcome) and opponents of an open competitive market? Or does "left-wing" mean "right-wing" now? (Tom, what do you think? Not sure anyone else will read this far!)</p>
