<p>Another Christian song that expresses the Christian hope well is one of my favourites, <a href="http://www.phatfish.net/featured/thereisaday/"><em>There is a day</em>, by Nathan Fellingham (2001)</a> of <a href="http://www.phatfish.net/">Phatfish</a>. Helpfully, it doesn't make us look forward to escaping this creation and going somewhere else, but the first lines express the Christian hope for the creation itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a day that all creation's waiting for,<br />
A day of freedom and liberation for the earth.</p></blockquote>
<p>What follows is simply <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/search/rom8:19-21;1cor15:51-54;2cor4:17-18;1th4:16-17;1jn3:2;rev21:4/">saturated with Scripture</a>. Here's the chorus:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will meet Him in the air,<br />
And then we will be like Him,<br />
For we will see Him as He is, oh yeah!<br />
Then all hurt and pain will cease,<br />
And we'll be with Him forever,<br />
And in His glory we will live,<br />
Oh yeah, oh yeah!</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of meeting the Lord in the air as he descends from heaven to earth at his <em>parousia</em> (royal visit) is helpfully explained by Tom Wright:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]heir 'meeting' with the Lord doesn't mean they will then be staying in mid-air with him. They are like Roman citizens in a colony, going out to meet the emperor when he pays them a state visit, and then accompanying him back to the city itself (Paul for Everyone: Galatians and Thessalonians, 125).</p></blockquote>
<p>It gives a renewed perspective on all that I do on earth to think that Jesus will one day be paying a royal visit, not to take me away, but to put everything right, and to stay here for ever. "Oh yeah" indeed!</p>
