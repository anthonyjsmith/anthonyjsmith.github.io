<p>To be free to choose is to be free from commitment</p>
<p>... because to be committed means you've chosen already.</p>
<p>To be free to choose is to be free from belonging</p>
<p>... because if you belong you won't choose not to belong.</p>
<p>To be free to choose is to be free from making choices</p>
<p>... because once you've made a choice you are no longer free to choose.</p>
<p>To be free to choose is to be free from any ties</p>
<p>... because ties limit your choices.</p>
<p>To be free to choose is to be free from certainty</p>
<p>... because if your mind is closed you are not free to consider new ideas.</p>
<p>To be free to choose is to be free from needing anything</p>
<p>... because if you depend on something you can't choose to be without it.</p>
<p>To be free to choose is death.</p>
