<p>A bit of audience participation for the churchgoers out there...</p>
<p>What are the main reasons you go to church?</p>
<ol>
<li>To hear good teaching? (But why not stay at home and listen to sermons online or read books?)</li>
<li>Because I really like the music?</li>
<li>To chat with friends after the service? (But why not have an extra hour in bed and show up just in time for post-service refreshments? Or why not just arrange regular informal times of fellowship?)</li>
<li>Because my church is small, and the services are like small group meetings in which everyone contributes (groups discussions, etc.), and I find that participating in them is the best way for me to grow in my faith?</li>
<li>Not for my own benefit, but to welcome unbelievers who may show up, and to share the gospel with them?</li>
<li>For the food?</li>
<li>Reluctant and grudging obedience?</li>
<li>Some other reason?</li>
<li>I'm really glad I do, but I can't explain why!</li>
</ol>
