<p>Do you believe in God?  Yes?</p>
<p>Whoa, hold on a minute! Which God are we talking about?</p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p><em>Which</em> God do you believe in?</p>
<p>You see, the assumption is that we all know what God is; we may differ on the details, but there's no dispute about the fundamental definition.  So if you were of a philosophical bent and didn't get out much, you might say:</p>
<blockquote><p>God is a living being, eternal, most good, so that life and duration continuous and eternal belong to God; for this is God. ... It is clear then from what has been said that there is a substance which is eternal and unmovable and separate from sensible [touchable] things. It has been shown also that this substance cannot have any magnitude, but is without parts and indivisible ... . But it has also been shown that it is impassive and unalterable</p></blockquote>
<p>Many Christians would think that's a pretty good description of God.  Trouble is that it was written by a pagan philosopher from the 4th Century BC!</p>
<p>Those words, from <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.12.xii.html">Aristotle's <em>Metaphysics</em></a>, are quoted by Mike Reeves in the <a href="http://theologynetwork.org/christian-beliefs/doctrine-of-god/trinity-1--why-we-have-problems-with-trinity.htm">first of his sensational four-part series on the Trinity</a>, the God of the Bible.  The question is whether Aristotle got it right: is his description of "God" a good summary of what the Bible's God is like?</p>
<p>Mike Reeves' answer: No.</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to acknowledge straight up that the Christian worships an entirely different God to whatever God anyone else worships.</p></blockquote>
