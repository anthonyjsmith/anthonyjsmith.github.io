title: Does the AV guarantee majority support?
---
<p>The "Alternative Vote" is <a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/article.php?id=55">clearly a huge improvement</a> on the "First Past The Post" system currently used to elect MPs in the UK, mainly (in my opinion) because it means I can simply write down my order of preference on the ballot paper, rather than having to second-guess how everyone else will vote and deciding to vote for my second-choice candidate in order to keep out my third-choice candidate, only to find that my first-choice candidate fails to win by one vote.</p>
<p>So I'll be <a href="http://www.yestofairervotes.org/">voting "Yes" in the referendum on 5 May 2011</a>.</p>
<p>But it doesn't exactly help the cause when the main proponents push inaccurate claims such as <a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/article.php?id=55">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All MPs would have the support of a majority of their constituents</p></blockquote>
<p>and <a href="http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/?p=2435">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Choosing the Alternative Vote means when a winner crosses that finish line on Election Day they’ll have to bring the majority of voters with them.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://melangerie.blogspot.com/2010/05/more-dodgy-reasoning-on-electoral.html">Phil Walker does a nice job of explaining all this</a> (it's quite simple really) and Wikipedia has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_vote#Examples">real example, in which the winner of a mayoral election in the US, held using the AV, had the support of 48.6% of the voters</a>.</p>
