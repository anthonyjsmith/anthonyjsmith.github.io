Just a quick announcement to say that I've been given the green light to train for ordained ministry in the Church of England! The interviews (the 'BAP') took place three weeks ago, but I thought I'd wait until after this morning's meeting with the bishop before saying anything here.

It's been quite a lengthy process to get to this point: I first had a meeting with the Diocesan Director of Ordinands in February 2014. On the whole it's been a very beneficial experience, though not without one or two bumps in the road. But in the end I seem to have emerged with a very strong recommendation from the BAP, which is quite a relief!

The next step towards becoming a vicar is to find a college to train in, starting in September...
