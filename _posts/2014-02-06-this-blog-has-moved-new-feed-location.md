I've moved this blog over to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and over to my new(ish) domain, [www.enkaptic.co.uk](http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/). Old links should keep redirecting... but not for very long!

In particular, the RSS feed location is now [http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/feed/](http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/feed/), so you should update your settings in your feed reader. (What? No feed reader? Seriously, [you should try one](http://www.problogger.net/what-is-rss/)! I use [feedly](http://feedly.com/).)

Or if you want to subscribe by email, [you can do that here (with FeedBlitz)](http://www.feedblitz.com/f/f.fbz?track=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.enkaptic.co.uk%2Ffeed%2F).
