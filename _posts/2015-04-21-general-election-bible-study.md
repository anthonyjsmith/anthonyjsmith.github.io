I cobbled this Bible study together at the weekend. It is unrefined and untested, but I post it here in case it might be useful. The main inspiration is [_Votewise 2015_ (Guy Brandon)]({% post_url 2015-03-21-a-christian-guide-to-the-general-election-votewise-2015 %}), along with [an associated talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qi_sFK4a9g). The latter used the excellent idea of focussing on one topic per major party (roughly speaking), and I've followed that approach below. One emphasis from the book was the implications of these issues for ordinary everyday life, as well as for politicians. It's so easy to assume it's entirely their responsibility (and hence their fault).

I don't expect anyone will follow this study and end up knowing who to vote for (at least, I hope they won't). But it might help people to approach the topic in a slightly better way.

1. Government
   1. Read 1 Peter 2:13-17. What should our attitude be towards the government?
   1. Read Deuteronomy 17:18-20. What limits does this place on the power of the king?
   1. Read 1 Samuel 13:11-14. What does God think about people trying to have unlimited power?
   1. How can we make sure governments don't get too much power? (Think about mass surveillance as an example.)
   1. How can we make sure corporations don't get too much power?
1. Economy
   1. Read Matthew 6:24. How can the economy become our master?
   1. Read Matthew 22:37-40. What matters to God is our relationship with him and our relationship with each other. How do you use your money to strengthen those relationships?
   1. We might use the word "shalom" to describe a society with strong relationships and with everyone able to flourish. How can we make sure the economy is not our master, but is used for "shalom"?
   1. Read Proverbs 22:7. Why should we get out of debt?
   1. How can we help each other to get out of debt, and to stay out of debt?
   1. How should the government get itself out of debt?
1. Immigration
   1. Read Matthew 28:18-20. What should our attitude be to "the nations"?
   1. Read Zechariah 7:10 and Leviticus 19:34. The Hebrew word for "alien" is "ger". How were these "immigrants" treated?
   1. Read Deuteronomy 23:19-20. The word for "foreigner" is "nokri". They were temporary visitors to Israel who were economically independent. How were these "immigrants" treated?
   1. How do you think we should treat people who want to settle permanently, such as refugees, economic migrants, and others?
   1. How do you think we should treat people who are here temporarily, such as international students, or people here for work or business?
1. Health
   1. Read Mark 5:24-34. How does Jesus heal this woman's body?
   1. How does Jesus heal this woman's state of mind?
   1. How does Jesus restore this woman's place in her society?
   1. The World Health Organisation states, "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". What can we do, as individuals, families and churches, to promote people's well-being?
   1. What should the government do to promote people's well-being?
1. Environment
   1. Read Genesis 1:28 and 2:15. What should our attitude be towards creation?
   1. Read Hosea 4:3. What happens when we don't take good care of the land?
   1. What can we do, as individuals, families and churches, to make sure the world is cared for?
   1. What should the government be doing to make sure the world is cared for?
