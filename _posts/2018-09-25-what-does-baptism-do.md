One of the many great things about living in Durham for the past two years has been the opportunity to spend time with [Alastair Roberts](https://alastairadversaria.com/). Alastair is a fount of biblical and theological knowledge, and has recently started making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkS1-6kt64WIHegj-h25_g) responding to [submitted questions](https://curiouscat.me/zugzwanged). Recently he shared [a few thoughts on baptism](https://alastairadversaria.com/2018/09/12/video-what-does-baptism-do-for-a-person/), along these lines:

* What does baptism do for a person?
* Apparently a great deal!
* But how does that work? 
* Think of a wedding ceremony. It is the entrance into a lifelong union. Baptism, likewise, is the entrance into a new life. It does not have magical powers, but it must be received properly, as is the case with a wedding ceremony.
* Think about adoption. Its significance is mostly seen in what happens next. Baptism, likewise, leads on to new life in Christ.
* The efficacy of a wedding ceremony is seen in a lifelong union.
* The efficacy of baptism is seen in an ongoing life of faith in Christ.
* Think of a coronation. It seals and confirms something that is already the case, but also brings it to a new level of existence. Baptism is similar.
* Many do not enter into the reality of baptism. Its true significance is seen when the sign is received by faith.
* Baptism is performed on our bodies.
* My body precedes my agency, subjectivity and volition. It is the basis of my selfhood.
* Baptism therefore claims us at a deeper level than that of our agency, subjectivity and volition.
* Christ's story is focused on his body: birth, death, resurrection, etc.
* Baptism marks out our bodies for resurrection.
* Our bodies are much more significant than we often realise.
* Baptism connects us with Christ's redemptive work, and with the story of Scripture. For example, baptism connects us with creation out of water, the flood, the Red Sea crossing.
* Baptism does wonderful things, by the Holy Spirit, when received by faith.
