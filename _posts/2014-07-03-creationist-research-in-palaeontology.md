Leonard Brand is a [biologist and palaeontologist](http://resweb.llu.edu/lbrand/). He's also a [young-age creationist](http://www.universitypress.andrews.edu/catalog.php?key=198). He believes the world was deluged by a global flood just a few thousand years ago.

These slightly unconventional beliefs give him a [slightly unconventional way of looking at things]({% post_url 2010-06-16-a-christian-approach-to-science %}). He ends up noticing things that would be overlooked by conventional scientists, and he can countenance explanations that would seem absurd to other people.

As a consequence, he does some fascinating scientific research. And he [publishes it](http://resweb.llu.edu/lbrand/articles.html) in high-ranking secular peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Have a watch...
