<p>PhD now submitted, I've just started a six-month contract working at <a href="http://astronomy.sussex.ac.uk/">Sussex</a> on some software for the <a href="http://www.esa.int/science/herschel">Herschel Space Observatory</a>, which is due to be launched in 2009. Here it is:</p>

<p>This week I'm at the <a href="http://www.scitech.ac.uk/About/Find/RAL/Introduction.aspx">Rutherford Appleton Laboratory</a>, near Didcot, Oxfordshire, discussing the nitty-gritty of how the data processing system is going to operate. (Okay, other people are discussing the nitty-gritty, while I'm feeling pretty gormless...)</p>
