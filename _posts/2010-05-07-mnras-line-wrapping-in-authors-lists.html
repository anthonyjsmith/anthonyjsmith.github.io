<p>In case anyone else using the <a href="http://www.wiley.com/bw/static/mnras_latex.asp">MNRAS LaTeX class</a> has been tearing their hair out inserting line breaks manually into long author (and institution) lists, using <code>\newauthor</code>, here's how I did it:</p>
{% highlight latex %}
\author[J.~Bloggs et al.]
{\parbox{\textwidth}{J.~Bloggs,$^{1}$\thanks{E-mail: \texttt{j.bloggs@no.where}}
J.~Bloggs,$^{2,3}$
J.~Bloggs,$^{3}$
J.~Bloggs,$^{4}$
J.~Bloggs,$^{5}$
J.~Bloggs,$^{6}$
%...
J.~Bloggs$^{99}$ and
J.~Bloggs$^{100}$}\vspace{0.4cm}\
\parbox{\textwidth}{$^{1}$Department of Something, Somewhere\
$^{2}$Department of Something, Somewhere\
$^{3}$Department of Something, Somewhere\
$^{4}$Department of Something, Somewhere\
$^{5}$Department of Something, Somewhere\
$^{6}$Department of Something, Somewhere\
%...
$^{99}$Department of Something, Somewhere\
$^{100}$Department of Something, Somewhere}}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Next: a Python script to generate the above from a simple list of authors and affiliations.</p>
