<p>Dear BHA,</p>
<p>After re-loading <a href="http://www.humanism.org.uk/">your website home page</a> a few times, I found on it the following <a href="http://freethinker.co.uk/2009/02/19/the-gentle-secularist-an-interview-with-ariane-sherine/">quote by Ariane Sherine</a>: "All children should be free to grow up in a world where they are allowed to question, doubt, think freely, and reach their own conclusions about what they believe." As an evangelical Christian, I wholeheartedly agree.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.humanism.org.uk/"><img title="Ariane Sherine on the BHA website" src="/assets/sherine_bha.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>However, you recently acted as signatories to a <a href="http://evolutionnotcreationism.org.uk/position-statement/">statement about creationism and 'intelligent design'</a> that asserted that</p>
<blockquote><p>There should be enforceable statutory guidance that [creationism and 'intelligent design'] may not be presented as scientific theories in any publicly-funded school of whatever type.</p></blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as contradictory. Many people believe that creationism or intelligent design are scientific theories. (Moreover, some people also believe them to be true!) Will you encourage children to reach their own conclusions on the matter?</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Anthony Smith</p>
<p><strong>Update 22 Sep 2011</strong>: Todd Wood has written a <a href="http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2011/09/letter-to-great-britain.html">Letter to Great Britain</a> in response to the campaign. It's a good read!</p>
