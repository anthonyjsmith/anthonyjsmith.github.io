title: Does free will explain the fall?
---
<p>Have you ever read or heard anything like <a href="http://carm.org/god-satan-garden-sin">this</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>Freedom of choice means that temptations will occur. Robots with no free will are not tempted, they can only respond according to their programming. But Adam and Eve were different. Being made in the image of God, they had free will which, for them, necessitated the option of rebellion, an option that was provided by the devil. If it hadn't been him, it would have been something else later on!</p></blockquote>
<p>I certainly have, many times.</p>
<p>As an explanation for the fall, I'm uneasy about it for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, it's not an explanation you can find anywhere in the Bible. If there really was such a simple explanation for the fall, isn't it strange that it isn't spelled out for us?</p>
<p>Second, and more significantly, if having free will means that sin is inevitable, then why hasn't God fallen into sin? Does God not have free will?</p>
<p>No, I don't think we can explain the fall so easily. But is that a problem? Should we expect to be able to explain sin easily? I don't think so. In fact, perhaps the reason it isn't easy to make sense of sin is that sin quite simply doesn't make sense! Can we look at sin in our own lives and say, "Yup, it makes perfect sense why I did that, I have free will, so I was bound sooner or later to turn and spit in the face of the One who has shown me nothing but kindness and mercy all my days"? What nonsense. I'm no more bound to sin by my free will than I'm bound by my free will to rub my face in horse manure. Or to eat Marmite. And however free our wills are, Adam and Eve's wills were definitely freer, so if free will can't explain why we sin, then it certainly can't explain why they sinned.</p>
