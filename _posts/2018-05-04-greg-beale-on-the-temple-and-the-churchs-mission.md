Why, in Revelation 21, when John sees the _new heaven and earth_, does it look like 'a _city_ in the shape of a _temple_ that's _garden_-like'? So asks [Greg Beale](https://faculty.wts.edu/faculty/beale/) in a fascinating talk about his 2004 book, [_The Temple and the Church's Mission_](https://www.ivpress.com/the-temple-and-the-church-s-mission) (5:15 into the talk). After discussing that passage in Revelation, his answer goes something like this:

* The _garden_ of Eden was a _temple_, and humanity was commissioned to expand the temple to fill the earth (15:55-34:40)
* Perhaps Noah's ark was a temple too (34:40-36:20)
* The patriarchs built little temples in the land (36:20-44:45)
* Israel's tabernacle, and later their _temple_, was a model of _heaven and earth_, pointing ahead to the _new heaven and earth_, which would be filled with God's presence (44:45-58:30)
* Christ and his followers are a temple in the new creation (58:30-1:09:00)
* As priests in this new temple, the church mediates between God and humanity, and is called to expand this temple to fill the world with the presence of God (1:09:00-1:15:00)
