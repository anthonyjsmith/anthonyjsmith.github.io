<p>I'm always delighted when I hear people speaking about the true Christian hope for the future: not that we will escape this earth and go to heaven for eternity, but that Jesus will return to this earth, and that we will live here for ever.</p>
<p>But sometimes the language we use doesn't convey that clearly. Here are some words and phrases I often encounter.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heaven</strong>. Sometimes we use the word "heaven" as a convenient shorthand for the Christian hope. I suppose the justification would be that it's familiar language, and it conveys the idea of being with God for ever. But it really makes me uncomfortable. It's wrong: we're not going to heaven for ever. And being with God for ever isn't the only thing it's important to believe about our eternal hope. <strong>Alternatives: earth, eternity, etc.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The new creation, the new heaven(s) and the new earth</strong>. This comes from Revelation 21:1. But, very literally, that verse says, "And I saw heaven new and earth new". I suspect that "a new heaven and a new earth" is grammatically fine as a translation (but what do I know? I still try to multiply the letters together when I try to read Greek!), but a few verses later, we read of the one on the throne saying, "Behold, I am making all things new". Note: <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tullian/2011/05/13/making-all-things-new-not-all-new-things/">making "all things new", not "all new things"</a>. The problem with saying "new X" in English is that it sounds like "replacement X" (e.g., "new car", "new shoes"). But we're not looking forward to a "new creation" in the sense of a "replacement creation". The creation itself is looking forward to being set free, not to being replaced. We're looking forward to the present old-and-worn-out creation being turned into the dazzling-and-made-new creation. I don't think that "the new creation" conveys that idea adequately in English. <strong>Alternatives: the renewed creation, the heaven(s) and the earth when God makes them new.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We will ... in the new heaven(s) and the new earth</strong>. So where are we now? "In the heaven(s) and the earth"? That just sounds weird. <strong>Alternative: we will ... on the renewed earth</strong><strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>There</strong>. "When we've been there ten thousand years". When we've been where? Where's "there"? <strong>Alternative</strong>: <strong>here.</strong> Or instead of being all Platonic and contrasting life "here" with life "there", talk about life "now, in this present age" and contrast that with life "<strong>then, in </strong><strong>the age to come</strong>".</li>
<li><strong>At the end of time</strong>. When Jesus returns, will all clocks stop? <strong>Alternatives: in the age to come, when Christ returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
