<p>What better way to spend Good Friday evening than at a live performance of possibly the most profound piece of music ever composed? I'm referring, of course, to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/bach/notes_st_matthew_passion.shtml">Bach's St Matthew Passion</a>, which can be heard in <a href="http://www.bachchoir.org.uk/future.htm">the next East Sussex Bach Choir concert</a> at St Bartholomew's Church, Brighton, at 7pm on 6th April. (Be sure to book in advance.)</p>
<p>I'll be in the choir as an extra, but I'll also have a small solo part, singing the words of Pilate.</p>
