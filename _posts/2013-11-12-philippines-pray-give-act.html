<p><a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/topical-prayers/prayer-for-the-philippines.aspx">Pray</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>O loving Creator, bring healing and hope to those who, at this time, grieve, suffer pain, or who have been made homeless by the force of flood in Philippines.</p>
<p>We remember those who have died and we pray for those who mourn for them.</p>
<p>May we all be aware of Your compassion, O God, which calms our troubled hearts and shelters our anxious souls.</p>
<p>May we pray with humility with our troubled and struggling brothers and sisters on earth. May we dare to hope that through the generosity of the privileged, the destitute might glimpse hope, warmth and life again.</p>
<p>Through our Saviour Christ who lives with us, comforts us and soothes us. Amen.<span style="background-color: transparent; color: #4e4e4e; font-style: normal;"><br />

<p><a href="http://www.tearfund.org/en/news/philippines_typhoon/">Give</a> (or <a href="http://www.dec.org.uk/">here</a> or anywhere).</p>
<p><a href="http://act.350.org/sign/haiyan/">Act</a>, if you suspect that ongoing carbon emissions will make things even worse for those who are vulnerable to storms, typhoons and other extreme weather events.</p>
