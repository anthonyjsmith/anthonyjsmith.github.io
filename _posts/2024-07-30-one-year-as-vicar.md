On 6 August 2023, I was 'licensed' as vicar ('priest in charge') of the 'Riverside Parishes' near Darlington: [Middleton St George](https://stlmsg.org), [Hurworth](https://www.allsaintshurworth.org), [Girsby (Sockburn)](https://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/13608/) and [Low Dinsdale](https://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/13599/). As the anniversary approaches, time for a bit of reflection...

It's been an exciting time! It's been a pleasure and privilege to get to know everyone, and a joy to serve alongside so many committed people. By God's grace, nothing has gone horribly wrong, and a lot of things have gone pretty well. I was expecting it to be a ['quantum leap']({% post_url 2023-07-05-the-quantum-leap-from-assistant-to-senior-minister-adrian-beavis %}), moving from being a curate to being a vicar, and it certainly has been (especially moving into a 'proper' multi-church context, where I am not in each church every week). I was also expecting it to take around three years to adjust, and that seems realistic too.

The things that have warmed my heart most of all have been when people display an appetite for God. It could be people coming (back) to church and lapping it all up with joy and excitement. It could the 'light bulb' moments when something 'clicks' in a person's faith, or the delight in discovering a great Christian book. It could be someone taking the next step in their walk of faith, perhaps serving in a new way and finding God to be faithful. Or it could simply be the people who keep on going in their faith, even when life is hard.

The work itself has been quite full-on. I'm gradually settling down, but it's a slow process. For a fruitful long-term ministry, it is essential to make time for prayer, rest, relationships, reflection and study. People talk about the importance of character in making appointments. I'm not saying anything about my own character, but I've certainly had to rely on my instincts again and again, as there simply hasn't been time to think carefully about every decision. On top of that, as a 'newbie vicar', there are lots of things I've been doing for the first time, which requires extra energy and a fair bit of learning on the job.

Key lessons? Mentors have been helpful. The 'Newbie Vicars' Facebook group has been a godsend! A bit like a rudder steering a ship, big changes can happen if you are gentle, consistent and patient. Sometimes a gentle nudge is all that is required. Avoid saying, 'leave it with me': it's better to equip people to do things themselves. Don't panic if something isn't being done right. Prioritise investing in people. Put your trust in God, not in the state of the Church of England. Keep praying, and keep positive!

One of the hardest things has been the sheer flexibility of the role. There are certain duties I have to perform, but I have a huge amount of freedom. The trouble is that there are countless things I want to do! There are well over 100 people who attend at least one of the churches fairly regularly, and I would love to get to know them all better. With four churches, there are numerous people who have a role, whether on one of the PCCs, or as a lay minister or a leader of some kind, and I want to support each of them and equip them in their ministry. I want to invest energy in the PCCs. I want to start new small groups and courses. I want to be out there sharing Jesus. I would love to be more involved in all of the schools in the parishes. As the vicar of two villages and some farming communities, there are countless doors open to me. It's a constant challenge to know what to do and what not to do, and even to find the time to think about it! Please pray for me!
