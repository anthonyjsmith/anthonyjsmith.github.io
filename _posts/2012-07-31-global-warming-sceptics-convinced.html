title: Global warming sceptics convinced
---
<p>The <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/">Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST)</a> project published some new results a couple of days ago. Here's <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/pdf/berkeley-earth-press-release-july-29.pdf">what they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a new Berkeley Earth study released today, the average temperature of the Earth’s land has risen by 1.5 °C over the past 250 years. The good match between the new temperature record and historical carbon dioxide records suggests that the most straightforward explanation for this warming is human greenhouse gas emissions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not too surprising, except that the study was launched because of a genuine scepticism about previous findings. "I was not expecting this," <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/pdf/berkeley-earth-press-release-july-29.pdf">says</a> project founder Richard Muller, "but as a scientist, I feel it is my duty to let the evidence change my mind." He <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all">now describes himself</a> as a "converted sceptic".</p>
<p>What of the remaining "climate change sceptics"? <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/jul/30/what-evidence-take-convince-climate-sceptics">Leo Hickman in the Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The key question for me is whether climate sceptics actually <strong>want</strong> to tackle that all-important question. What evidence will it take to convince them? Are they forever destined to keep saying "it's not enough for us"? When does the balance of risk tip over in favour of them accepting that pumping ever more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is not a wise thing to keep on doing?</p></blockquote>
