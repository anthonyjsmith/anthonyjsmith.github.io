title: The Sundays of the church year
---
<p>OK, this is slightly boring and nerdy, but I've been trying to get my head round the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/media/1172724/weekday%20lectionary%202005.pdf">Church of England Weekday Lectionary</a>Â (2005/2010), and part of that is to figure out the Sundays of the church year. It's slightly confusing, because Christmas can happen on any day of the week, and Easter is all over the place.</p>
<p>But here it is, with dates included, based on the <a href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/seasons.aspx">list of Sundays in <em>Common Worship</em></a>. Sundays marked with an *asterisk do not happen every year. Dates in (parentheses) are for leap years. Note that there are up to five Sundays before Lent, and up to five Sundays after the 18th Sunday after Trinity, and of these ten, only five or six fall in any given year (and it's approximately equally likely to be five or to be six). I think it's all correct: comments welcome!</p>
