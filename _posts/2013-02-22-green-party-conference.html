title: Green Party Conference
---
<p>The <a href="http://www.greenparty.org.uk/">Green Party</a> is celebrating its 40th birthday this weekend in Nottingham at its <a href="http://greenparty.org.uk/conference.html">party conference</a>. I'll be there (from tomorrow). It will be my first ever political party conference, so I'm quite excited. Here are some of the things I'm hoping to get out of itâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li>I've been in the Green Party for <a title="I've joined the Green Party" href="/2011/09/12/ive-joined-the-green-party/">almost 18 months</a>, but I still don't feel I really know how the party actually works. I'm looking forward to learning more about that.</li>
<li>I might even get to vote on things that might even make a difference to what the Green Party does in the future!</li>
<li>I'm looking forward to meeting other people in the Green Party and learning what makes them tick. I'm sure there will be plenty of fascinating people there.</li>
<li>I'd like to learn more about how the party sits with respect to Christian faith. On the one hand, <a title="Green politics: holistic politics" href="/2012/12/29/green-politics-holistic-politics/">green politics</a> seems to <a title="Why would a Christian join the Green Party?" href="/2011/09/13/why-would-a-christian-join-the-green-party/">fit very comfortably with Christian faith</a>, not least in its <a title="Why should Christians care for creation?" href="/2013/01/21/why-should-christians-care-for-creation/">care for the world in which we live</a> (and <a title="Creation care: an urgent call to action" href="/2012/11/17/creation-care-an-urgent-call-to-action/">here</a> and <a title="Why Christians should be environmentalists" href="/2012/09/25/why-christians-should-be-environmentalists/">here</a> and <a title="Responding to climate change" href="/2012/04/23/responding-to-climate-change/">here</a>). But, on the other hand, the Green Party seems quite anti-Christian on various issues (such as <a title="Abortion: if a woman is denied her autonomy, is she denied her humanity?" href="/2012/11/09/abortion-if-a-woman-is-denied-her-autonomy-is-she-denied-her-humanity/">abortion</a> [and <a href="http://brightgreenscotland.org/index.php/2012/10/anti-abortion-bullshit-bingo/">here</a>] and <a title="Freedom from nature" href="/2013/02/18/freedom-from-nature/">a view of human identity that has nothing to do with biological gender</a>, hence the party's <a title="Is it un-Green to oppose same-sex marriage?" href="/2012/08/02/is-it-un-green-to-oppose-same-sex-marriage/">strong views on same-sex marriage</a>). It's probably not possible to answer the question of what the party as a whole thinks of Christian faith. But I'd at least like to hear a few individual perspectives, to see if there is anything approaching a general consensus, and to figure out which issues are influenced by this. I'd certainly love to see the party making a more conscious effort to appeal to people of various faiths.</li>
<li>I'm sure there will be quite a buzz at the conference, and I'd like to pick up some enthusiasm!</li>
<li>Finally, I've given in to pressure from the surrounding culture, and I now have a (second-hand) "smart" phone. So I'm looking forward to feeling cool by <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith">tweeting</a> from my gadget during the conference sessions and adding a few pence (and only a few pence!) to my mobile bill with <a href="http://www.thephone.coop/home/mobile/">The Phone Co-op</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe see you there!</p>
