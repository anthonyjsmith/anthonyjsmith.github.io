<p>Tedious and technical posts related to my research in astronomy are henceforth to have a home on this blog (update: I've made a separate <a href="http://www.enkaptic.co.uk">Research Blog</a> for them).</p>
<p>[old bits snipped]</p>
<p>In case you suddenly fear you'll be missing out, "my research in astronomy" roughly translates as "how I finally persuaded the computer to do X, and why in hindsight X is pointless and I should have made the computer do Y instead".</p>
