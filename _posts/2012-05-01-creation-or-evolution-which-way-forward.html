<p><em>I posted this <a href="http://cis.org.uk/forum/discussion/23/what-todd-wood-would-like-to-hear-an-evolutionary-creationist-say">elsewhere</a> a few months ago, but I thought it was worth posting it here too. The Christian church is still a long way from resolving the creation/evolution issue, but maybe this points in the right direction.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.colossianforum.org/">Colossian Forum</a> is some new thing trying to promote discussion on issues of science, culture and Christian faith. They invited young-age creationist <a href="http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/">Todd Wood</a> to write an article for them on <a href="http://www.colossianforum.org/2011/11/09/article-what-i-would-like-to-hear-an-evolutionary-creationist-say/"><em>What I Would Like to Hear an Evolutionary Creationist Say</em></a>. So what would Todd Wood like to hear an evolutionary creationist say?</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps when people ask if Christian theology is compatible with evolution, the first answer should be, “I don’t know.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues,</p>
<blockquote><p>As a young age creationist, let me take this opportunity to follow my own advice and publicly express my ignorance. If creationism is true, why can we see starlight from stars millions of light years away? I don’t know. If creationism is true, what does radiometric dating mean? I don’t know. If creationism is true, why do humans and chimpanzees have nearly identical genomes? I don’t know. Just like evolutionary creationists wrestling with theological issues, though, young-age creationists have proposed all sorts of answers to the above questions. Some weren’t very good ideas, but others are quite intriguing. And just like evolutionary approaches to theology, there is no single creationist scientific model that most creationists would accept.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in conclusion,</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to the origins fight, maybe the key is to follow Christ’s example. Maybe the only way we’ll ever resolve the war is through surrender. Maybe in surrender, we’ll find out what real victory is. Maybe we’ll find that confessing ignorance is the first step towards finding God’s truth. Maybe we’ll discover that asking for wisdom is just what God wanted us to do all along. Most important of all, maybe we’ll find that we can humbly ask for wisdom <em>together</em>, and in doing so, the world really will see something different about us.</p></blockquote>
