title: Multi-site mega-churches and their bishops
---
Since reading [Paul Avis on the Anglican understanding of the church](/2013/11/13/paul-avis-on-the-visibility-of-the-church/), I've been pondering the idea that, in Anglican thinking, the basic unit of the church is not the local parish church, but is the diocese, with the bishop as the senior pastor. In other words, Anglican churches are really multi-site mega-churches, with each church covering a particular part of the country (a city with the surrounding region), and with that region divided into zones (or "parishes"), with each zone having its own elder or elders and its own weekly meeting(s). The only significant difference between the Anglican model and the modern version is that I'm not aware of Anglican dioceses live-streaming videos of their bishop preaching every week.

Anyway, Andrew Wilson picks up this idea in a much more snappy way over at Think Theology: [_Ignatius Meets the Multi-Site Gurus_](http://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/ignatius_on_multi_site). Enjoy!
