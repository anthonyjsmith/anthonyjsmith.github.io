title: Why vote yes to AV?
---
<p><img title="I'm voting Yes!" src="/assets/imvotingyes.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Just a reminder that, for me at least, May is the month for saying "Yes!"</p>
<p>And here is why I would recommend a "Yes!" vote in the alternative vote (AV) referendum this Thursday.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pretty much everything you've heard against AV is not true. It's not complicated, it's not expensive and it's not unfair, for example.</li>
<li>AV will deal effectively with the problem of <strong>tactical voting</strong>. Currently, if you want your vote to count most effectively, you need to guess how everyone else will vote so you can figure out whether you need to vote for candidate A in order to prevent candidate B from winning, even though you'd ideally like candidate C to win. You won't need to do that kind of thing any more under AV. That is a Good Thing.</li>
<li>AV will deal effectively with the problem of <strong>splitting the vote</strong>. Currently if there are two similar candidates, they might split the vote, meaning that neither of them wins, and a third candidate - a generally disliked candidate - wins instead. That won't happen under AV, which guarantees that a generally disliked candidate cannot win. That also is a Good Thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/referendum_2011.aspx">Electoral Commission website</a> for details about the referendum and what AV is, and the <a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/article.php?id=55">Electoral Reform Society website</a> for more about why AV is better than our current system, first past the post (FPTP).</p>
