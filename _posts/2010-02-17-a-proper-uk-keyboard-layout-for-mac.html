title: A proper UK keyboard layout for Mac
---
<p>Macs are marvellous. So many differences. Better in every way. But, having said that, some of the more trivial differences just plain irritating. For example, the keyboard layout. Why does the "British" keyboard layout switch @ and ", switch | and ~, put ` in place of \ and \ in place of #? Why? Why? Hold on, where is #? Well, duh! Alt-3, of course! And - remember how expensive real estate is on a keyboard - why on earth is there a <em>whole key</em> devoted to § and ±?</p>
<p>I had almost got used to this - part of the initiation rite as a Mac devotee - but now I have two machines on my desk at work, with different keyboard layouts, so it's driving me pretty crazy. Enough is enough. <a href="http://blob.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdutton/2009/08/real-mac-uk-keyboard-layout/">Real Mac UK Keyboard Layout</a> (hat tip: <a href="http://www.serberus.net/2010/02/17/a-real-uk-keyboard-layout-for-mac-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard/">Greg Knapp</a>).</p>
