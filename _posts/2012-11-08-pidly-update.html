<p>It's been a while since I posted anything here. And today won't mark a significant change in that pattern, I'm afraid. But my python-IDL interface, <a href="https://github.com/anthonyjsmith/pIDLy">pIDLy</a>, has been mentioned elsewhere a couple of times, so I thought I might as well put the links up here.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, IDL guru <a href="http://michaelgalloy.com/2012/07/30/idl-use-from-python.html">Michael Galloy found pIDLy</a>, liked it, and has been updating his <em>Modern IDL</em> book to mention it!</li>
<li>Then GÃ¶khan Sever has been trying out pIDLy with not just IDL but also GDL and FL, and wrote about his experiences <a href="http://pycloud.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/calling-idl-gdl-and-fl-from-python.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not doing much python or IDL these days, but <a title="pIDLy on GitHub" href="/2012/06/07/pidly-on-github/">pIDLy is on GitHub</a> if anyone wants to develop it further...</p>
