title: Filtering astro-ph with CosmoCoffee

<p>One of the things mentioned in <a href="http://www.sarahbridle.net/">Sarah Bridle</a>'s talk at <a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/YAM/">YAM</a> last week was a filter for <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> provided by <a href="http://cosmocoffee.info/">CosmoCoffee</a>. I decided to sample it this week.</p>
<p><a title="CosmoCoffee" href="http://cosmocoffee.info/"><img class="img-responsive" title="CosmoCoffee" src="/assets/logo_phpbb.gif" alt="CosmoCoffee" /></a></p>
<p>After creating an account on CosmoCoffee, you will need to edit the keywords in your profile to reflect your interests (well, I did!). Then click on <a href="http://cosmocoffee.info/arxiv_new.php">Arxiv new filter</a> and you're off!</p>
<p>Here are my settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arxives in order of interest: astro-ph</li>
<li>Arxiv New search key strings: galaxy (redshift )?survey, luminosity (function|density), surface brightness, UKIDSS, UKIRT, VISTA, SDSS, Sloan, WFCAM, near infrared, stellar mass, star formation (rate|history), galax, Bayes, redshift, astro-ph, ADS, extragalactic</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday: 54 new on astro-ph, of which 21 made it through the filter. These were not only filtered but also sorted by CosmoCoffee so the most relevant were listed first. Very useful.</li>
<li>Tuesday: 76 on astro-ph; 27 on CosmoCoffee. It missed <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1513"><em>The Future of Cosmology</em> by George Efstathiou</a>, which was a fun read. But I can't think of any way to adjust the CosmoCoffee filter to catch papers like this, without catching loads of other cosmology papers. But in the full astro-ph listings I skimmed over the <a href="http://uk.arxiv.org/abs/0712.1382">paper on globular clusters and their host galaxies</a>, which was ranked highly by CosmoCoffee.</li>
<li>Wednesday: 42 on astro-ph; 14 on CosmoCoffee, filtered and sorted just right.</li>
<li>Thursday: 52 on astro-ph; 22 on CosmoCoffee. Hmm, wish I knew more about dwarf galaxies.</li>
<li>Friday: 30 on astro-ph; 7 on CosmoCoffee (must be getting near Christmas). Glad I skimmed through astro-ph, as my filter settings excluded <a href="http://uk.arxiv.org/abs/0712.2196">this fascinating article on the history of dark energy</a>. Apparently Newton thought of it (or something like it) 320 years ago!</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: based on this week's experience, I'm likely to miss interesting and relevant papers if I use either astro-ph or CosmoCoffee ... so I'll use both! Start each day <em>adagio</em> on CosmoCoffee, <em>accelerando poco a poco</em>, then <em>prestissimo</em> through astro-ph.</p>
