<p>We watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E">WALL-E (2008)</a> last night.</p>
<p>It's a great story. It's about planet earth, a planet that was supposed to be beautifulâ€”in its landscapes, in the plants and animals it supported, and in the human civilisation that developed on it. But this planet had been left desolate, reduced to a heap of trash by the greed, futility and disconnectedness of the people who inhabited it. But it's also a story of hope. A love story develops between the central character, WALL-E, and another robot. And so powerful is this love story that it brings in its wake not only the re-humanising of humanity, but ultimately the renewal of the whole planet.</p>
<p>And it's a whole lot of fun too.</p>
<p>But what I like most about this story, as about any story, is the resonances it has with a far greater story...</p>
