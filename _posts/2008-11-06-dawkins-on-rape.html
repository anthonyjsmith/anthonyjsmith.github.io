<p>Presenter of <a href="http://www.premier.org.uk/unbelievable">Premier Radio's <em>Unbelievable?</em> programme</a> "Justin Brierley spoke to prominent atheist Richard Dawkins after his debate with Professor John Lennox at Oxford University in October 2008." Here's what was said 5:30 into <a href="http://media.premier.org.uk/misc/4b519ce0-5a9e-4b1d-86ca-8def12ebd5c1.mp3">the interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>JB: But when you make a value judgement don't you immediately step yourself outside of this evolutionary process and say the reason this is good is because it's good, and you don't have any way to stand on that statement?</p>
<p>RD: But my value judgement itself could come from my evolutionary past.</p>
<p>JB: So therefore it's just as random in a sense as any product of evolution.</p>
<p>RD: Well, you could say that. But it doesn't in any case - nothing about it makes it more probable that there is anything supernatural.</p>
<p>JB: Okay, but ultimately, your belief that rape is wrong is as arbitrary as the fact that we've evolved five fingers rather than six.</p>
<p>RD: You could say that, yeah.</p></blockquote>
