I'd love to write a post under this title, but, fortunately for me (and for you!), fellow Green Party member Stephen Gray has saved me the hard work!

His reasons for voting Green stem from God's concern for the environment, and God's concern for the poor.

You can read his article [on the God and Politics blog](http://godandpoliticsuk.org/2014/02/10/im-a-christian-and-this-is-why-i-vote-green/). (There are also posts by other people on why they vote [Conservative](http://godandpoliticsuk.org/2014/02/03/im-a-christian-and-this-is-why-i-vote-conservative/) and [Labour](http://godandpoliticsuk.org/2014/02/06/im-a-christian-and-this-is-why-i-vote-labour/), and maybe more in the pipeline.)

But, if you are desperate to read something from my own pen (or fingers) about my membership of the Green Party, try reading these posts from when I joined the Green Party in 2011:
