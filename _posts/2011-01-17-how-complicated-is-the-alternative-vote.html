<p>I've been slightly bemused by <a href="http://www.no2av.org/">claims</a> that the Alternative Vote (AV) is more complicated than the voting system we currently endure in the UK, First Past The Post (FPTP). So I made a flowchart to show how to vote under each system. You can decide for yourself which is simpler. And (if you are eligible) on 5 May you can vote for whichever system you prefer to be used for UK General Elections, whether you voteÂ <a href="http://www.yestofairervotes.org/">"Yes"</a> to introduce AV or <a href="http://www.no2av.org/">"No"</a> to keep FPTP.</p>
