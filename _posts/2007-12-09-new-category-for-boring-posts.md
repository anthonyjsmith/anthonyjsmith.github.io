Tedious and technical posts related to my research in astronomy are henceforth to have a home on this blog (update: they are now tagged under [astronomy](/tag/astronomy) or [computing](/tag/computing/)).

[old bits snipped]

In case you suddenly fear you'll be missing out, "my research in astronomy" roughly translates as "how I finally persuaded the computer to do X, and why in hindsight X is pointless and I should have made the computer do Y instead".
