title: 'Evangelicals Now: singing and tweeting'
---
<p>Well, it's been almost two months since my last update. I suppose if this were a blog, that would be unacceptable.</p>
<p>Anyway, I still don't have anything interesting to say, so I'll have to defer to others.</p>
<p>And, fortunately, some decent articles from <a href="http://e-n.org.uk/">Evangelicals Now</a> appeared in my <a href="http://beta.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> feeds this morning.</p>
<p><a href="http://e-n.org.uk/"><img title="evangelicals_now" src="/assets/evangelicals_now.gif" alt="evangelicals_now" /></a></p>
<p>First, Richard Simkin has some <a href="http://e-n.org.uk/4744-The-Music-Exchange.htm">helpful thoughts about congregational singing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We must get rid of the idea that bands, organists or choirs provide the music for churches. Instead, it’s the congregation which makes up the choir that sings praises to God — the congregation is the main provider of the music that reaches God’s ears (and that we hope pleases him). Musicians may facilitate congregational singing, but that’s all we do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then James Cary <a href="http://e-n.org.uk/4745-Watching-the-web.htm">puts Twitter in perspective</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is this web-based fad doing and showing us about ourselves? It demonstrates a longing for community and friendship. ... We inflate our sense of self-importance and consider ourselves to be something of a celebrity. ... For those of us who tweet, or use Facebook, it is worth considering what kind of person we are presenting. Is it the real us?</p></blockquote>
<p>That's enough for today. For those of you following my celebrity life, a link to this post should soon appear on <a href="http://twitter.com/anthonyjsmith">my Twitter page</a>.</p>
