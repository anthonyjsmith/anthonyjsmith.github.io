<p>I thought I'd share a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKf0Xm6wWVI">video</a>Â from <a href="http://www.tearfund.org/">Tearfund</a>, which I saw on Saturday as part of an <a href="http://cconcc.wikispaces.com/Culmination+Events+in+York+Minster+and+York+St+John+University">event</a> in York looking at a Christian response to climate change:</p>
