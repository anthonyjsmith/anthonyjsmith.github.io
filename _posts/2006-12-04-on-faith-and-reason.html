<p>Religious knowledge is about faith, but scientific knowledge is about reason, right?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>At least, not according to <a href="http://bethinking.org/resource.php?ID=288&amp;Topic=&amp;Category=">this talk (MP3) by Andrew Fellows</a>. After examining various views of the interplay between reason and faith, he argues (convincingly) that "true understanding is always preceded by faith" because "we cannot arrive at knowledge until we first make a commitment to a starting point" (following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi">Polanyi</a>). In science this starting point is the tradition we inherit, which both shapes and moulds our understanding and also tells us which questions we should be asking.</p>
<p>A cautionary note to those who think that science is objective but religion is subjective.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Have a listen! Great thing to do while on the bus, walking home or washing up.</p>
