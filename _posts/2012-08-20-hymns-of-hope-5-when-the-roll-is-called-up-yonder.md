It's not hard to find [hymns that express the Christian hope for the future]({% post_url 2015-11-26-hymns-of-hope %}) (wrongly) as a hope to escape this world and spend eternity far away in heaven. A prime example of this is James M Black's 1893 hymn <a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/w/h/e/whenroll.htm"><em>When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there</em></a>. I've taken the liberty of making a few changes (in <strong>bold</strong>). I'm not too keen on "in glory" in place of "up yonder", but it was the best I could do. Let me know what you think...

<blockquote><p>When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and <strong>death</strong> shall be no more,<br />
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;<br />
When the saved of earth shall gather <strong>here and all shall be restored</strong>,<br />
And the roll is called <strong>in glory</strong>, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>When the roll is called <strong>in glory</strong>,<br />
When the roll is called <strong>in glory</strong>,<br />
When the roll is called <strong>in glory</strong>,<br />
When the roll is called <strong>in glory</strong>, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,<br />
And the glory of His resurrection share;<br />
When His chosen ones shall gather <strong>from</strong> their home beyond the skies,<br />
And the roll is called <strong>in glory</strong>, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>When the roll...</p>
<p>Let us labour for the Master from the dawn till setting sun,<br />
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;<br />
Then when all our <strong>toil</strong> is over, and our <strong>suffering</strong> is done,<br />
And the roll is called <strong>in glory</strong>, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>When the roll...</p></blockquote>
