<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ironmanposter.JPG"><img class="alignright" title="Iron Man poster" src="/assets/ironmanposter.jpg" alt="Iron Man poster" /></a>Just back from a film discussion at <a href="http://www.calvary-brighton.org.uk/">my church</a>, at which we watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_man_(film)"><em>Iron Man</em> (2008)</a> and then used the following questions to delve under the surface of this <em>deeply</em> philosophical film:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which character did you like the most?</li>
<li><em>Iron Man</em> is a superhero story. Does this kind of story appeal to you?  Why?</li>
<li>Do you think people in our society are looking for a superhero, or is it just a story that we tell?</li>
<li>Listen to these two quotes
<ul>
<li>Tony Stark: "I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Obadiah Stane: "How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!"</li>
</ul>
<p>If there was a real Iron Man, do you think that would help in ridding the world of weapons?</li>
<li>Some people think that the stories we tell about a superhero who saves the world actually become real in Jesus.  Why might people think that Jesus is the real superhero?  Why might they think he isn't?</li>
<li>How did Tony Stark and Pepper Potts’s relationship develop through the film?</li>
<li>Obadiah Stane said this to Pepper Potts: "Tony never really did come home, did he? He left a part of himself in that cave.” How would you compare Stark before and after his time in the cave? What effect did Yinsen have on Stark?</li>
<li>Who or what do you think is the real enemy in the film?</li>
</ol>
