<p>Horatio Spafford's moving hymn, <em><a href="http://www.hymnary.org/text/when_peace_like_a_river_attendeth_my_way">When peace, like a river</a></em>, is somewhat marred by a line in a verse that apparently was not in the <a href="http://spaffordhymn.com/html/manuscript.html">original version</a> or even the <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/gospelhymns16sank#page/412/">original (?) published version</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, Lord, ’tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,<br />
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;<br />
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!<br />
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!</p></blockquote>
<p>(I'd be interested to know where that verse came from: leave a comment below if you know.)</p>
<p>I've taken to singing "The <em>earth</em>, not the grave is our goal", because the Christian hope is ultimately not to stay in heaven (the sky?) for ever, but for the Lord to return, for the dead to be restored to bodily life, and for the meek to inherit... the sky?</p>
<p>But perhaps better would be to miss out that verse altogether, and to stick with Spafford's final verse, which is much richer:</p>
<blockquote><p>And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,<br />
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;<br />
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,<br />
Even so, it is well with my soul.</p></blockquote>
