<p>Commenting on the scandal of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7873145.stm">nurse Caroline Petrie offering to pray for a patient</a>, Peter Hichens made <a href="http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2009/02/snow-surrender-i-saw-no-roaming-polar-bears-or-ravening-timber-wolves-just-the-final-proof-that-our-.html">this observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After an earlier incident she was told that the ‘Nursing &amp; Midwifery Council code’ states that ‘you must demonstrate a personal and professional commitment to equality and diversity’ and ‘you must not use your professional status to promote causes not related to health’.</p>
<p>These are amazing statements, both sinister and self-contradictory. She must promote Left-wing politics, but she must not mention Christianity.</p>
<p>Equality (alias Marxism) and Diversity (alias political correctness) are contentious and highly political aims, not at all ‘related to health’. Yet she ‘must’ be personally and professionally committed to them.</p></blockquote>
