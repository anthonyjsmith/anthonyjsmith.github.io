It's quite embarrassing when you can't recite the creed by heart but the congregation can!

But it's understandable: unlike the congregation, you might regularly be reciting not one but four creeds, all subtly different: the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed, each taken from [_The Book of Common Prayer_](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer) (BCP) and from [_Common Worship_](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship) (CW).

I put the following table together a while ago, but I've just dusted it off for public consumption ([PDF](/assets/creeds.pdf)/[Word](/assets/creeds.docx)). It has the four creeds in four columns, with the similarities and differences highlighted.

[![Table containing four creeds](/assets/creeds.png)](/assets/creeds.pdf "PDF version")

To explain (examples taken from the BCP Apostles' Creed):

* **Bold**: common to all creeds
  * Row 5: **The third day he rose again** ...
* No formatting: unique to this creed
  * Row 5: ... from the dead
* <u>Underlined</u>: common to both versions of the <u>Apostles'</u>/<u>Nicene</u> Creed
  * Row 5: <u>He descended</u>
* _Italic_: common to both creeds in _BCP_/_CW_
  * Row 8: **the Holy** _Ghost_
* _<u>Underlined and Italic</u>_: combined
  * Row 8: _<u>I</u>_ **believe**

The rows show what is [apparently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed) 'the traditional division into twelve articles' for the Apostles' Creed, spelling and punctuation are from the respective book, and non-indented line breaks are as in _Common Worship_ (see p. 142 for the BCP Apostles' Creed and p. 234 for the BCP Nicene Creed).

(Perhaps appropriately, last night I read a book chapter with the title, 'Are vicars sad?')
