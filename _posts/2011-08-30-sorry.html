title: Sorry

<p>I have an apology to make.</p>
<p>I have been living as a Christian in a world dominated by greed.</p>
<p>And yet this hasn't bothered me at all.</p>
<p>I have thought it is perfectly possible to serve both God and money.</p>
<p>I have thought it is possible to preach the gospel faithfully without demonstrating either by what I say or by the way I live that I reject the idols of our age.</p>
<p>In fact, I have thought that challenging or rejecting the idols of our age would be a distraction from preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>I have made myself a worshipper of those idols by seeing my identity as a consumer and my worth in terms of what I consume.</p>
<p>And I have thought that worshipping those idols is okay, so long as I go to church, read the Bible, pray, don't swear very much, and try to be nice to people.</p>
<p>I have thought that God's purposes for the world would be fulfilled by everyone acting according to their own narrow economic self-interest, and I have behaved accordingly.</p>
<p>I have consistently acted with no concern for the poor: today's poor, or tomorrow's poor.</p>
<p>I have used the self-righteousness of some who boast about how "ethical" they are as an excuse for my own indifference as to whether my actions are "ethical" or not.</p>
<p>I have said I believe that the world was created good, and that people were created to steward its limited and precious resources well, and yet lived as though I didn't care at all how quickly or irreversibly those precious resources are used or destroyed.</p>
<p>In fact, I have thought that a society should be measured in terms of how quickly it uses the earth's resources.</p>
<p>I have said I believe that <em>this</em> creation will be restored and transformed when Jesus returns, and yet lived as though the only purpose of <em>this</em> creation was to satisfy my greedy desires.</p>
<p>I have acted in ways that the Bible describes in terms of adultery, thinking I could serve the God of the Bible and simultaneously prostitute myself to gods of money, greed and covetousness.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Lord.</p>
<p>Please help me to repent.</p>
<p>Please help me to follow you.</p>
<p>(Amen?)</p>
