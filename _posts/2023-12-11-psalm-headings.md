Before reading (or praying) one of the psalms, it can often be helpful to get yourself in the right frame of mind. One way of doing that would be to read it twice. But another way would be to read something a bit shorter. That's what I've tried to do here, with a brief heading for each of the psalms.

I'm aiming for something between the headings you might get in some Bible translations (e.g., [NRSV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-Anglicised-NRSVA-Bible/), [ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/English-Standard-Version-Anglicised-ESV-Bible/)), and the ['Where to find help when...'](https://gideonsinternational.org.uk/helps/) section at the start of my old Gideons New Testament and Psalms. A couple of examples...

An easy one to start. Psalm 3 begins with 'O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, how many are my foes!' (NRSV, ESV). Here are the headings:

* NRSV: 'Trust in God under Adversity'
* ESV: 'Save Me, O My God'
* Gideons: referenced under 'Where to find help when ... Intimidated'
* Below: 'Surrounded by foes'

In this case, there isn't really any need of a heading, as the situation is clear from the first line.

However, that isn't always the case.

One example where a heading is helpful would be Psalm 89. For the first 37 verses, everything seems to be fantastic. God is reigning, and David is on the throne. However, all of a sudden, 'But now you have spurned and rejected him' (NRSV). That's the kind of thing that can really take you by surprise when reading the psalm. But presumably it wasn't a surprise to the psalmist, and nor does it come as a surprise once you are familiar with the psalm. It seems to be intended more to take _God_ by surprise! 'God, you did this, and you said this, and you promised this ... _but look at us now!_'

This one doesn't feature in my Gideons 'Where to find help when...' section ('taunted'?), but here are the other headings:

* NRSV: 'God’s Covenant with David'
* ESV: 'I Will Sing of the Steadfast Love of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>'
* Below: 'God's anointed apparently abandoned'

Hopefully my heading prepares you for the psalm as a whole.

I put these together a few years ago, along with reading (very helpful) comments on the psalms by C. John Collins in the [ESV Study Bible]({% post_url 2023-06-09-esv-study-bible %}). I'm not claiming they are perfect by any means, but I've been finding them helpful, as something to read before reading the psalm itself.

Here they are in a printable format ([Word](/assets/psalm-headings.docx)/[PDF](/assets/psalm-headings.pdf)): print double-sided and cut it in half and then you have two copies!
