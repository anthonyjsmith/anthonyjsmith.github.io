<p>Thanks to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://getk2.com/">K2</a> and <a href="http://coldmedia.co.uk/">ColdMedia</a>, I've been able to give this site a new feel. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>I don't want to start writing a blog (I'll explain why in my next post - d'oh!), so I maintain that this is not a blog. But it does use some really useful blogging technology, such as RSS feeds.</p>
<p>Feeds such as RSS or Atom enable you to keep track of updates to web sites without having to visit them individually. I use <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines.com</a> for this. Most days I check my Bloglines page and it tells me about the latest news stories (on BBC News and others), articles on various science pages and updates to various friends' web sites - oh, and the latest <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a> strip, of course. So, rather than checking 30 or so web sites for updates, I need to check only one. And if I'm offline for a week, it will remember what I have read and what I haven't read, so I don't even need to check every day.</p>
<p>There we are. Sign up with <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, add this page to your list of feeds, and it will watch my site day and night for any updates!</p>
