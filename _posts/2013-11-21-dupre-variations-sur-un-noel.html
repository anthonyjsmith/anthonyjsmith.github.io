title: 'Dupré: Variations sur un Noël'
---
<p>Way back in 1999 (that's 14 years ago), I used to be not too bad on the organ. (I say "I", but all the atoms in my body have been replaced a couple of times since then, so I'm not sure it really was me.) Since then, it's all gone downhill, but I did make a couple of recordings of my recitals before I turned to studying numerology and astrology (or whatever it was, I find it hard to remember things!). The following is taken from a little concert I gave at Southwell Minster, at the end of my year there. It's a set of variations by Marcel Dupré on the melody <em>Noël Nouvelet</em>. Apologies for the sound quality... anyone remember cassette tapes?</p>
