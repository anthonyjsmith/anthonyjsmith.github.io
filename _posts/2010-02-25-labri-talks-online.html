<p><a href="http://labri.org/">L'Abri</a> (French for "the shelter", or possibly "the cheese") is a network of residential study centres committed to providing "honest answers to honest questions about the reality and relevance of the Christian faith". I've just found out (hat tip to Mike C) that many of their talks are now available online for free download. This is a fantastic resource. There seem to be well over 300 talks on there so far (MP3), with over 100 by Francis Shaeffer himself. Here, check it out for yourself:</p>
