title: A cappella Bach
---
<p>This Saturday (17 March) I'll be singing (as an extra) with the Brighton Consort for <a href="http://www.brightonconsort.org.uk/bach_and_german_tradition.htm">Bach and the German Tradition</a>, featuring two of Bach's glorious motets for unaccompanied choir and other delights from the same period. Should be fun!</p>
