title: The human being who rules the universe
---
> He has raised our human nature  
in the clouds to God's right hand;  
there we sit in heavenly places,  
there with him in glory stand:  
Jesus reigns, adored by angels;  
man with God is on the throne;  
mighty Lord, in thine ascension  
we by faith behold our own.

Christopher Wordsworth (1807-1885), [_See the Conqueror mounts in triumph_](http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/s/e/seetheco.htm)
