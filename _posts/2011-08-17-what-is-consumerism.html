title: What is consumerism?
---
<p>Thinking aloud, I wonder if we could characterise <strong>consumerism</strong> as being a view of the world in which the <a title="A non-reductionist theory of reality" href="/2011/08/03/a-non-reductionist-theory-of-reality/">sensory aspect</a> is the only aspect that matters. (In that sense consumerism would be reductionist, not in denying that the other aspects are <em>real</em>, but in denying that they are ultimately <em>significant</em>.)</p>
<p>So we could ask a consumerist some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How are you, Mr Consumerist?</strong> I'm <em>feeling</em> great/dreadful.</li>
<li><strong>Why do you want a new iPhone?</strong> My current phone makes me <em>feel</em> boring, and a new iPhone will make me <em>feel</em> good about life.</li>
<li><strong>That's not very rational, is it?</strong> So what?</li>
<li><strong>Why did you buy those expensive trainers?</strong> It makes me <em>feel</em> good to be seen in them.</li>
<li><strong>Why are you going somewhere exotic on holiday? </strong>I want the <em>experience</em> of something new.</li>
<li><strong>Why did you give money for the famine in Africa?</strong> It makes me <em>feel</em> bad seeing that on the TV.</li>
<li><strong>Why is it important to have law and order?</strong> It makes me <em>feel</em> safe.</li>
<li><strong>What exists in the cosmos, apart from yourself?</strong> Lots of things that have the potential to make me <em>feel</em> amazed, fascinated, satisfied, happy, amused, exuberant, loved and significant — and, sadly, lots of negative sensations too.</li>
<li><strong>Look, a tree!</strong> Yes, something that gives me the <em>feeling</em> of wonder, the <em>sensation</em> of seeing something I consider to be beautiful, the <em>fascination</em> of studying it, the <em>thrill</em> of climbing it, the <em>satisfaction</em> of reaching the top, the <em>taste</em> of its fruit, and the <em>warmth</em> of it burning in the fireplace.</li>
<li><strong>Tell me about God, if you believe in him?</strong> I believe in him, and he makes me <em>feel</em> loved, forgiven and good about myself.</li>
<li><strong>The Sun is one of around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, which is itself one of around 100 billion galaxies in the known Universe. </strong>Let me tell you how that makes me <em>feel</em>.</li>
<li><strong>What is important to you in life?</strong> I want to <em>experience</em> life: the <em>feelings</em> of <em>affection</em> and <em>significance</em> that come through family and friends, the <em>feeling</em> of <em>satisfaction</em> at doing an interesting job where I can make a real difference, the <em>feeling</em> of having a moral code and sticking to it, and the endless <em>experiences</em> that are available to me through technology, communications and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>A quick search online suggests that I'm perhaps not alone in this line of thinking. For example, <a href="http://www.dooy.salford.ac.uk/andrew.html">Andrew Basden</a> writes in <em><a href="http://chimera69.essex.ac.uk/@api/deki/files/110/=IJMAP2011-Basden.pdf">A Presentation of Herman Dooyeweerd's Aspects of Temporal Reality</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Absolutization (undue elevation) of any aspect brings harm because it breaks inter-aspect coherence. Absolutization of aspects in theoretical thought leads to other aspects being either ignored (example: positivism) or explained away in terms of the favoured one (example: evolutionism). Absolutization of aspects in society’s mindset (example: <strong>consumerism</strong>) destroys other aspects of society, such as justice or generosity (p.24, my emphasis).</p></blockquote>
