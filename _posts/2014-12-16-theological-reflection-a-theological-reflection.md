**1. Experience**

I wrote a [theological reflection](http://www.davidheywood.org/RCC/Y1%20TR/documents/Green%20handout.pdf). You are reading it.

**2. Exploration**

This seems so simple!

**3. Reflection**

Are there any theological reflections in Scripture?

* Psalm 73 (NIV).
  * **Experience**: "I envied the arrogant" (1-3).
  * **Exploration**: "They have no struggles" (4-15).
  * **Reflection**: "I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny" (16-20).
  * **Response**: "I have made the Sovereign L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds" (21-28).
* 1 Samuel 28 (NIV).
  * **Experience** and **exploration**: "When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid" (3-5).
  * **Reflection**: "He enquired of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, but the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> did not answer him" (6).
  * **Response**: "Saul then said to his attendants, 'Find me a woman who is a medium, so that I may go and enquire of her.'" (7).

It seems that the latter is an example of a _bad_ theological reflection!

**4. Response**

I like theological reflection. It is better than either (1) experience without reflection, or (2) reflection disconnected from experience. But there is such a thing as bad theological reflection. It isn't a magic bullet.
