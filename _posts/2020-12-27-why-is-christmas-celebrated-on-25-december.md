So wrote [John Sweet](https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2009/31-july/gazette/obituary-canon-john-philip-mcmurdo-sweet) in his Introduction to [_Using Common Worship: Times and Seasons (All Saints to Candlemas)_](https://www.chpublishing.co.uk/books/9780715123096/using-common-worship-times-and-seasons-part-1) (p. 6).

One suggestion is that it was 'the Christianization of a pagan festival', namely, the 'birthday of the unconquered Sun', which was celebrated on 25 December. But Sweet prefers an alternative explanation:

> It seems more likely that the true clue is the date of Passover (25 March in the West, 6 April in the East) and Jewish identification of end with beginning: seeing the conception of Jesus as one with his Paschal victory and dating his birth nine months later. Such temporal coincidences were commonplace for the Jews, as they were for poets like T. S. Eliot and John Donne (see his poem ['Upon the Annunciation and Passion falling upon one day, 1608'](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Upon_the_Annunciation_and_Passion_Falling_upon_One_Day._1608)).

If this is correct, it does help to emphasise the unity of God's redemptive work in Christ: incarnation, death and resurrection are intricately connected.

It also makes me wonder why we don't make more of the Annunciation? It's not as if the incarnation happened when Jesus emerged from his mother's womb, after all: the unborn baby was God incarnate from the moment of conception.

However, calendars are messy, and even if there was originally a connection between Passover and the Annunciation, it has been obscured by the subsequent [dating of Easter]({% post_url 2016-03-28-dating-easter-a-brief-and-inadequate-guide %}), and even further by our rules for ordering the Christian year. In fact, if the Annunciation has the audacity to fall between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter, it is transferred to the following Monday!

Perhaps it's time to reform our calendars and straighten everything out...?
