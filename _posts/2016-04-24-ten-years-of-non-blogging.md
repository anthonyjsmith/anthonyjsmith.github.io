There have been lots of tenth anniversaries so far this year. 21 March was [the tenth anniversary of Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/2016/thank-you-love-twitter). 21 March was also [the tenth anniversary of the Archbishop Cranmer blog](http://archbishopcranmer.com/archbishop-cranmer-10-years-of-religio-political-edification-and-enlightenment/). 13 April marked [ten years of the liturgy.co.nz website](http://liturgy.co.nz/celebrating-10-years-online). But the biggest celebration comes today, 24 April, which marks exactly ten years of blogging on this site. (Except that this isn't a blog, of course, as I explained in my [first]({% post_url 2006-04-24-ceci-nest-pas-un-blog %}) [three]({% post_url 2006-05-04-blogging-good-or-bad %}) [posts]({% post_url 2006-05-08-ceci-what %}).)

Here's how it all started:

[![Ceci n'est pas un blog](/assets/blog-2006.png)](/assets/blog-2006.png "Ceci n'est pas un blog")

But this site has actually been going for much longer than that. It started its life as a few tasteless HTML pages, some time around the turn of the millennium, kindly hosted by Jesus College Cambridge when I was an undergraduate there. Then I bought the anthonysmith.me.uk domain back in 2002, and kept things ticking over. It was ten years ago today that I switched over to WordPress (and then to [Jekyll]({% post_url 2014-02-14-wordpress-to-jekyll %})), and thus my blogging career began. Since then, I've written a massive 335 posts, which is, on average, just over one post every 11 days. I can't begin to tell you how many people have read my posts over the last decade. I've also received an untold number of comments. In fact, it would be difficult to deny that this site fills a much-needed gap in the internet!

So here's to the next ten years!
