title: Brighton going Green?
---
<p>I'm quite excited about this General Election thing. For one thing, struggling to overcome my very British apathy and cynicism, I'm beginning to find politics vaguely interesting. And I find myself in one of the most interesting constituencies for the coming election. A Conservative stronghold from its creation in 1950 until 1997, the Brighton Pavilion seat was gained by Labour in 1997. With the current MP due to retire, many people consider the frontrunner to be Caroline Lucas MEP, the leader of the Green Party. And, for the first time ever for a UK parliamentary seat, the shortlist is going to be all female, with the four major parties all fielding female candidates. Here's a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/video/2010/feb/03/brighton-pavilion-green-party">video about the situation from the Guardian's <em>Comment is free</em> pages</a>:</p>
