title: Vote Green on 22 May!
---
I haven't had much time for blogging lately, but I interrupt my (non-)blog silence for a brief party political broadcast.

I'll be voting for the [Green Party](http://greenparty.org.uk/) on 22 May, in both the European and local elections. (In fact, for the latter, as I'm fortunate enough to be living in Bebington, I'll be [voting for myself](http://www.wirralgreenparty.org.uk/)!) If I had more time, I'd give you some of my own reasons for voting Green. If I had even more time, I'd try to argue that the European Parliament actually matters, and that the European elections are not just a sideshow to the UK General Election. Suffice it to say that I don't think the Green Party is perfect, but I do think it is saying some extremely important things that are otherwise almost entirely absent from British political discourse.

So I leave you first with a video:

And then with the [Green Party mini-manifesto](http://issuu.com/lifework/docs/minimaniissuu?e=7496317/7612527), which is _very_ brief and _very_ readable:
