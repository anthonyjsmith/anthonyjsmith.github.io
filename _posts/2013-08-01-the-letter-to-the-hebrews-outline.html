title: 'The letter to the Hebrews: outline'
---
<p>The New Testament letter to the Hebrews is a richly structured book. The basic message of the letter is clear enough. The recipients of the letter were facing severe temptation to give up on being Christians, and to return to the Judaism of the Temple in Jerusalem, and the letter was written to warn them not to do that, and to remind them that being a follower of Jesus is unspeakably glorious and wonderful in comparison (despite superficial appearances to the contrary). And the basic message for us today is clear enough: Jesus is amazing, so don't give up on him! But within the letter, various themes are repeated and developed and connected in all sorts of ways, so it's difficult to give a simple or definitive outline. Nonetheless, I think a few basic contours can be discerned. Something vaguely like this, perhaps...</p>

<li>The supremacy of the Son (1:1-4), even to angels (1:5-2:18)
