<p>Now Python and IDL can talk to each other (okay, Python talks to IDL and IDL does what it's told), using <a title="pIDLy" href="https://github.com/anthonyjsmith/pIDLy">pIDLy</a> (pronounce as you please). I experimented with a few other solutions available online but couldn't get them to work. So I cobbled this one together with surprisingly little trouble, thanks largely to <a href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/">pexpect</a>.</p>
