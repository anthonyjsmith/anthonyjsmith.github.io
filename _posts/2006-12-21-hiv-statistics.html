<p><img title="Red Ribbon" src="/assets/redribbon.jpg" alt="Red Ribbon" class="alignright" />Earlier this week I sang in a choir for a Christmas concert to raise money for treatment of HIV patients. I thought I'd do some research.</p>
<p>It is often trumpeted that HIV and AIDS affect all kinds of people. That is true. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, it affects more women than men, and 24.5 million people are infected. In some countries, over 20% of adults are living with HIV. Worldwide, nearly 3 million will have died of AIDS in 2006 [<a href="http://www.avert.org/subaadults.htm">1</a>,<a href="http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm">2</a>]. These are staggering statistics.</p>
<p>In the UK, of all those adults living with HIV (estimated 63,500 by end of 2005), about 44% are men who have sex with men [<a href="http://www.avert.org/uksummary.htm">3</a>]. The rest are not. So it is clearly wrong to think of HIV as something that affects only gay men.</p>
<p>However, after playing around with a few numbers [<a href="http://www.avert.org/hsexu1.htm">4</a>,<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/populationestimates/svg_pyramid/uk/index.html">5</a>], the figure above suggests that around 5-10% of practising homosexual men are HIV positive [also <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6174200.stm">6</a>,<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/health_medical/article1996319.ece">7</a>]. That's a staggering statistic too.</p>
<p>Virtually all HIV cases could easily have been avoided. So much suffering and death due either to ignorance or to deliberate lifestyle choice! How tragic!</p>
