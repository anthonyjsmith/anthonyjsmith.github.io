<p><a href="http://galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a> is a project to get ordinary people (that's you) to help look through pictures of a million galaxies, labelling each one as a spiral galaxy, elliptical galaxy, etc. (People are better than computers at doing this sort of task.)</p>
<p>They'll have to be careful about drawing conclusions from this project, but it seems an excellent way to get the public to appreciate the vastness of the Universe and the beauty and diversity of some of the billions of galaxies that populate it. (And bear in mind that each galaxy contains billions of stars.)</p>
<p>Go on, join in!</p>
