As I begin my second year (of three) studying theology at Cranmer Hall (Durham), here is a quick update. (If you want to be reminded about what I was up to in my first year, see [my previous 'postcard']({% post_url 2016-11-03-postcard-from-durham %}).)

Over the summer I had some fascinating placement experiences:

* two weeks based in Leuven (Belgium) visiting the Diocese in Europe. I wrote about this in a separate post: [What is the Church of England doing on the continent?]({% post_url 2017-06-28-what-is-the-church-of-england-doing-on-the-continent %})
* four weeks on placement in Spennymoor (near Durham), at [St Paul's Church](http://www.stpaulsspennymoor.co.uk/), experiencing something resembling normal parish ministry, and
* two weeks on placement with a mental health chaplain in and around Darlington, learning what it means to be a Christian presence alongside people who are living with mental health problems.

Placements will continue during the autumn and spring terms, and this year I'll be on placement with a university chaplain.

In terms of my modules for the coming year, here is what I'm expecting:

* Biblical studies (~~11%~~ _13%_):
  * Further Biblical Studies
* Christian tradition (~~50%~~ _44%_):
  * Topics in Christian Doctrine
  * ~~Church Growth: Pentecost to Constantine~~
  * Science and Theology
  * Independent Learning Project (probably on something theological)
  * Ethics (smaller module)
* Church ministry and mission (~~22%~~ _25%_):
  * Denominational Ministry (Anglicanism)
  * Death and Dying
* Ministerial formation (smaller modules) (~~17%~~ _19%_):
  * Pastoral Ministry
  * Conflict Transformation
  * Reflective Practice

That's all for now; more to follow in due course!
