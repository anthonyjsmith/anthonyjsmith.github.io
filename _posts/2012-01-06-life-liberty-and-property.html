title: Life, liberty and property
---
<p>Ideas can stick around for a long time.</p>
<p>I've been watching some lectures on political philosophy: <a href="http://www.justiceharvard.org/"><em>Justice</em>, with Michael Sandel</a>. The episode below is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_locke">John Locke (1632-1704)</a>, and his very influential idea of people's inalienable rights to life, liberty and (bizarrely) property, ideas which were (coincidentally) formulated around the time that Europeans were colonising North America, and claiming its land as their own.</p>
<p>It seems that these quirky ideas about private property are still in vogue today, particularly among some (not all) who take the label "libertarian", and that there is a connection between holding these views and denying climate change. At least, that's what <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/jan/06/why-libertarians-must-deny-climage-change">George Monbiot</a> and <a href="http://mattbruenig.com/2011/12/21/environmentalism-poses-a-problem-for-libertarian-ideology/">Matt Bruenig</a> say.</p>
<p>Conclusion: philosophy really matters.</p>
