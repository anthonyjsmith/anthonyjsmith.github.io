<p>William Walsham How's classic hymn, <a href="http://www.hymnary.org/text/for_all_the_saints_who_from_their_labors"><em>For all the saints</em></a>, helps us to look forward to two things. First, we look forward to being with the Lord when we die:</p>
<blockquote><p>The golden evening brightens in the west;<br />
Soon, soon, to faithful warriors cometh rest;<br />
Sweet is the calm of paradise the blest.<br />
Alleluia! Alleluia!</p></blockquote>
<p>But wait—there's more! We're not going to spend eternity in that paradise we enter when we die. As Tom Wright would put it, there is life <em>after</em> life after death: the bodily resurrection of the dead at the return of Christ to the earth. The hymn continues...</p>
<blockquote><p>But lo, there breaks a yet more glorious day;<br />
The saints triumphant rise in bright array;<br />
The King of glory passes on His way.<br />
Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
<p>From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,<br />
Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,<br />
Singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:<br />
Alleluia! Alleluia!</p></blockquote>
<p>Alleluia indeed!</p>
