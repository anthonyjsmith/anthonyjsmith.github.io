<p>Natalie Bennett has been the leader of the <a href="http://www.greenparty.org.uk/">Green Party</a> for around 52 days. She's travelling around a lot, and <a href="http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10006387.Green_Party_highlights_the____huge_impact____of_public_service_cuts/">visited York on Wednesday</a>. I managed to catch her that evening, when she gave a <a href="http://york.greenparty.org.uk/news/299">talk at York University</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not planning on writing a summary of the talk. But, as an alternative, here's a short video about Natalie Bennett...</p>
