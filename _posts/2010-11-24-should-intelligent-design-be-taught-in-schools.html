<p>Many people in the UK believe in Intelligent Design (that is, they don't believe in modern evolutionary theory), 51% according to <a href="http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=70066">one report</a>. This in itself is a good reason to expect children at least to be familiar with the term and what it means.</p>
<p>They should learn about some of the arguments for ID (i.e., the arguments against modern evolutionary theory), and why most scientists reject those arguments.</p>
<p>They should use it to learn something about the sociology of science, and how ideas gain acceptance by the scientific community (or not, in this case).</p>
<p>They should use it to learn something about the philosophy of science, relating the pursuit of knowledge through the sciences to the pursuit of knowledge by other means, and applying that to ID.</p>
<p>And since the language in which the discussion about ID is conducted is the language of science, it should be the science teachers primarily who teach about ID.</p>
<p>Now have I said something controversialâ€¦?</p>
<p>(Of course, this wouldn't work in the USA, since they have a strange principle called the "separation of church and state", or something like that. Whatever it's called, this is what it seems to mean: public resources shall not be used to expose anyone to any argument that might be expected to lead to the adoption of any belief generally rejected by secular humanists. Now, secular humanists generally don't believe in an Intelligent Designer, so this means public schools cannot criticise modern evolutionary theory, because rejecting modern evolutionary theory generally leads to belief in an Intelligent Designer.)</p>
