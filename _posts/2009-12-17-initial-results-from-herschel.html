<p>A bigger venue now, for the <a href="http://herschel.esac.esa.int/SDP_IR_wkshop.shtml">first scientific results from the Herschel Space Observatory</a>. Not sure how much I can reveal right now (the presentations will be uploaded after the conference, and I think they might be embargoed until then) but the photo above gives you the general idea. In the corner you can just about see the figure of GÃ¶ran Pilbratt, the Herschel Project Scientist (who refused to stand still for the 8-second exposure), and on the screen he is dazzling us with an overview of the mission.</p>
<p>However, some results were revealed yesterday at a press briefing, and here they are...</p>
