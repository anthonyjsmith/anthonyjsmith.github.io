As I begin my third and final year studying theology at Cranmer Hall (Durham), here is a quick update. (If you want to be reminded about what I was up to in previous years, see my [first]({% post_url 2016-11-03-postcard-from-durham %}) and [second]({% post_url 2017-09-30-postcard-from-durham-2 %}) 'postcards'.)

This summer was a bit lighter on placements compared with 2017. In June a group of us from Cranmer Hall visited the Holy Land, staying in Tiberias and Jerusalem, and visiting various sites associated with Jesus. You can get a flavour of our trip on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cranmerpilgrims2018?f=tweets), but here's a group photo:

Then I spent two weeks on placement at [St Nicholas' Church in Sevenoaks](https://www.stnicholas-sevenoaks.org/), getting a feel for how a larger evangelical church operates. (You might even find [a recording on their website of a mid-week talk I gave](https://www.stnicholas-sevenoaks.org/resources/podcasts-other-talks).)

This year my term-time (Sunday) placement is at [St George's Church in Fatfield (Washington)](http://www.stgeorgesfatfield.co.uk/). I went along for the first time yesterday, and I'm looking forward to getting more involved.

But most of my time this year will be spent ~~dealing with emails~~ studying theology. During my first two years I completed the Cranmer Hall [BA in Theology, Ministry and Mission](https://community.dur.ac.uk/cranmer.hall/study-with-us/study-options/undergraduate-courses/). (They let me in at second-year level, because of some relevant prior learning.) This year I'll be taking the Cranmer Hall [MA in Theology and Ministry](https://community.dur.ac.uk/cranmer.hall/study-with-us/study-options/postgraduate-courses/). Two-thirds of the credit comes from four taught modules, and one third comes from a dissertation (15,000 words). In the dissertation I'm planning on thinking about what we should do when the Bible seems to make claims about science and history, but I don't have a detailed plan yet. [Dr Richard Briggs](https://community.dur.ac.uk/cranmer.hall/Staff/the-revd-dr-richard-briggs-2/) has kindly agreed to attempt to keep me on track with that. In terms of the taught modules, these will be:

* Two modules in the university [Department of Theology and Religion](https://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/):
  * [Paul and his Interpreters](https://www.dur.ac.uk/postgraduate.modules/module_description/?year=2018&module_code=THEO40130), with [Professor John Barclay](https://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/staff/profile/?id=2008)
  * [Doctrine of Creation](https://www.dur.ac.uk/postgraduate.modules/module_description/?year=2018&module_code=THEO44030), with [Professor Simon Oliver](https://www.dur.ac.uk/theology.religion/staff/profile/?id=14140)
* Two [modules](https://community.dur.ac.uk/cranmer.hall/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Handbook-of-MA-Module-Descriptors-2018-19.pdf) in Cranmer Hall:
  * Theological and Practical Reflection on Ministry and Mission, with various lecturers. I am hoping to focus on science and theology in this module
  * Early Christian Perspectives on Mission and Ministry, with [Dr Nick Moore](https://community.dur.ac.uk/cranmer.hall/Staff/the-revd-dr-nick-moore/)

And I'm hoping to learn Hebrew too...

And then what? Watch this space!
