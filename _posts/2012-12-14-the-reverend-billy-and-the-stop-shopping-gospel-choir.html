<p>This guy's a legend. And this film is awesome. Seriously! <a href="http://revbilly.com/">The Reverend Billy</a> is on a mission to save Christmas from ... the <em>shopocalypse!</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Pack the malls with folks with money<br />
Fa la la la la, la la la la<br />
Tis the season to be dummies<br />
Fa la la la la, la la la la<br />
Squeeze our fat in Gap apparel<br />
Fa la la, la la la, la la la<br />
Buy some junk for cousin Carol<br />
Fa la la la la, la la la la</p>
<p>Joy to the world! In the form of goods!<br />
Consume! Consume! Consume!<br />
Bright plastic this and thats!??<br />
For screaming little brats!<br />
Take the SUV to the mall!<br />
Take the SUV to the mall!<br />
And buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy it all.</p></blockquote>
