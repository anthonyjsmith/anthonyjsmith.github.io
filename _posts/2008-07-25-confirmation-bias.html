title: Confirmation bias
---
<p>Professor Aardvark has a theory. His theory predicts X. So he does some experiments and presents a <em>tentative</em> scientific result, suggesting that X might be true.</p>
<p>Dr Bloggs decides to investigate it. Here's Bloggs's research diary:</p>
<ul>
<li>First preliminary results (finally!): disagreement with Aardvark's results, but it's probably something I've done wrong.</li>
<li>New method of analysing the data. Now my results (finally!) agree with Aardvark's. Still a few issues that need addressing though...</li>
<li>No progress with the outstanding issues. Getting really bored of this project!</li>
<li>Paper written:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Aardvark found X. Our results, although tentative, appear to agree with their findings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr Clot-Head investigates the same question and publishes the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aardvark and Bloggs have shown that X is true. Our results agree with their analysis, although we haven't taken Y and Z into account, so our findings are only tentative.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr Dummy joins the bandwagon:</p>
<blockquote><p>Various authors have found X (Aardvark, Bloggs, Clot-Head). Our findings, although tentative, agree with the general consensus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, X is not true and Professor Aardvark's theory is wrong. However, due to the complexity of the issue, the lack of any credible alternative theory and constraints on the researchers' time, X soon becomes part of common knowledge. Everyone knows X is true!</p>

<p>My question: does this actually happen in astronomy?</p>
