<p>Here are some commonly-used words and expressions. On their own, they are completely neutral. But we don't hear them as neutral, because they are about the past, present and future. And we <em>know</em> (don't we?) that the present is better than the past, and the future will inevitably be even better than the present...</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the 21st Century!</li>
<li>The latest ...</li>
<li>You're living in the 19th/20th Century!</li>
<li>Up-to-date</li>
<li>That's unacceptable in this day and age</li>
<li>Modernise (we will modernise public services)</li>
<li>New recipe</li>
<li>Change (we promise to bring change)</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there other "neutral" expressions that express a similar (or contrary) view about where history is heading? Feel free to comment below!</p>
