<p><img class="alignright" title="The Myth of Religious Neutrality by Roy Clouser" src="/assets/clouser_myth.png" alt="" />I've now reached the end of Roy Clouser's book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Myth-Religious-Neutrality-Hidden-Theories/dp/0268023662/">The Myth of Religious Neutrality</a></em>. Normal service will now resume, with long periods of silence punctuated by assorted trivia, pictures, videos, and other musings.</p>
<p>But just in case you want to read it all over again, here's an index to my posts on the respective chapters, written as one very long sentence:</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="All of life is religious" href="/2011/04/08/all-of-life-is-religious/">All of life is religious</a>, because</li>
<li><a title="What is a religious belief?" href="/2011/04/21/what-is-a-religious-belief/">religious belief is belief about what is unconditionally and non-dependently real</a></li>
<li>(and <a title="Types of religious belief" href="/2011/05/01/types-of-religious-belief/">there are different types of religious belief</a>),</li>
<li>and <a title="How do religious beliefs affect all beliefs?" href="/2011/06/10/how-do-religious-beliefs-affect-all-beliefs/">these religious beliefs affect all of our beliefs about all of life</a></li>
<li>(and, by the way, <a title="A brief history of faith and reason" href="/2011/06/24/a-brief-history-of-faith-and-reason/">there are other ways of understanding how religious beliefs relate to other beliefs</a>)</li>
<li>(including the <a title="How do religious beliefs control other beliefs?" href="/2011/06/25/how-do-religious-beliefs-control-other-beliefs/">fundamentalistic approach</a>),</li>
<li>for example, <a title="Is mathematics religious?" href="/2011/06/29/is-mathematics-religious/">our religious beliefs affect our beliefs about mathematics</a></li>
<li>and <a title="How do religious beliefs influence physics?" href="/2011/07/16/how-do-religious-beliefs-influence-physics/">about physics</a></li>
<li>and <a title="The effect of religious beliefs on psychology" href="/2011/07/22/the-effect-of-religious-beliefs-on-psychology/">about psychology</a></li>
<li>and <a title="Is God less divine than his attributes?" href="/2011/07/23/is-god-less-divine-than-his-attributes/">this whole view of reality is closely linked in with our understanding of the nature of God</a>,</li>
<li>[11-13] so <a title="A non-reductionist theory of reality" href="/2011/08/03/a-non-reductionist-theory-of-reality/">we should try to build a view of reality based on a Christian view of God</a>.</li>
