... the donkey.

I hate to break it to you.

But there is no donkey.

In the Bible, at least.

There were donkeys around at the time, of course.

And there are donkeys in the Bible.

But no donkeys are mentioned in relation to the Nativity.

(There probably wasn’t a cattle shed either.)

To help set the record straight, a more historically-accurate Christmas song to offer have I...

Not a donkey!\\
Not a donkey!\\
Not a cattle shed!\\
We don’t know how Mary travelled –\\
Was it on a sled?

How did they go so far?\\
We don’t know!\\
We don’t know!\\
Maybe they had a car?\\
We don’t know!\\
We don’t know!

Not a donkey!\\
Not a donkey!\\
Not a cattle shed!\\
We don’t know how Mary travelled –\\
Was it on a sled?
