<p><a title="Stellarium" href="http://www.stellarium.org/"><img title="Stellarium" src="/assets/stellarium.jpg" alt="Stellarium" class="alignright" /></a>If, like me, you know virtually nothing about astronomy, wouldn't know which way to look through a telescope, but would quite like to be able to identify more than three objects in the sky, then <a href="http://www.stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a> is just what you've been looking for. (Much more suitable than <a href="http://earth.google.com/sky/">Google Earth-Sky</a> or <a href="http://sky-map.org/">Sky-map.org</a> for this particular purpose, if you ask me.)</p>
<p>As a <em>very</em> slightly geeky person, I found it easiest to navigate Stellarium using the keyboard: press 'H' for help, and 'M' to change the settings (location, time, etc.).</p>
