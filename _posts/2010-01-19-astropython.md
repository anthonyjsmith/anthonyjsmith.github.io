You (both of you) might well be interested in the new <a href="http://www.astropython.org/">Astropython</a> site, which looks excellent. Here's <a href="http://www.astropython.org/about">the site's own description</a>:

> Research in astronomy includes the analysis of astronomical images, parsing and manipulation of large catalogs, statistical yet often visual inference, and the creation of data visualizations for publication and dissemination of results.
>
> The purpose of this web site is to act as a community knowledge base for performing this research with the open source Python language. It provides a forum for general discussion, advice, or relevant news items, collecting lists of useful resources, users' code snippets or scripts, and longer tutorials on specific topics. The topics within these pages are presented in a list view with the ability to sort by date or topic. A traditional "blog" view of the most recently posted topics is visible from the site Home page.
