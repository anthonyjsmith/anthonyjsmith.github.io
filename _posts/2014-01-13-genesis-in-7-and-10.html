<p>The book of Genesis has <strong>ten</strong> major sections, each beginning with "These are the generations of ..." (<em>toledoth</em> in Hebrew). Before the first of these sections is the famous account of the creation in <strong>seven</strong> days (part of which featured in this morning's <a title="Bible in a year with the C of E" href="/2013/11/01/bible-in-a-year-with-the-c-of-e/">Bible readings</a>).</p>
<p>But this <strong>seven</strong>-day creation account also features the number <strong>ten</strong> (and lots of other numbers); significantly, <strong>ten</strong> times we read, "And God said". (Ten <em>words</em>, perhaps.) And three of the <strong>ten</strong> major sections are actually no more than genealogies, acting as preludes to subsequent narrative sections. So the bulk of the book divides quite neatly into 10 - 3 = <strong>seven</strong> sections.</p>
<p>The <strong>seven</strong> days divide quite neatly into <strong>3+3+1</strong> days: three days of calling/separating, three days of blessing/filling, and one day of rest. And the <strong>seven</strong> sections in the bulk of the book divide quite neatly into <strong>1+3+3</strong> sections: one section in (and then out of) the garden, three sections of corruption, and three sections of calling/separating (of one person out of a larger family) and blessing/filling (of that one person and his descendants).</p>
<p>And the verse separating the <strong>seven</strong> days from the <strong>seven</strong> sections has a mirror (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiasmus">chiastic</a>, [AB]CC[BA]) structure to it, as if the whole book is meant to hinge around this point (with the LORD God at the centre):</p>
<blockquote><p>These are the generations<br />
of the <strong>heavens and the earth</strong> when they were <strong>created</strong>,<br />
in the day that the LORD God <strong>made</strong> the <strong>earth and the heavens<br />
</strong>(Genesis 2:4, ESV).</p></blockquote>
<p>Putting that all together:</p>
<p><strong>Prologue</strong>: Creation in 3+3+1 days (1:1-2:3)</p>
<p>1. "The generations of <strong>the heavens and the earth</strong>" (2:4-4:26)</p>
<p>2. "The generations of <strong>Adam</strong>": genealogy (5:1-32) + corruption (6:1-8)<br />
3. "The generations of <strong>Noah</strong>": narrative (6:9-9:19) + corruption (9:20-29)<br />
4. "The generations of <strong>the sons of Noah</strong>": genealogy (10:1-32) + corruption (11:1-9)</p>
<p>5. "The generations of <strong>Shem</strong>" (11:10-26): genealogy + 6. "The generations of <strong>Terah</strong>" (11:27-25:11): narrative<br />
7. "The generations of <strong>Ishmael</strong>" (25:12-18): genealogy + 8. "The generations of <strong>Isaac</strong>" (25:19-35:29): narrative<br />
9. "The generations of <strong>Esau</strong>" (36:1-37:1): genealogy + 10. "The generations of <strong>Jacob</strong>" (37:2-50:26): narrative</p>
<p>All of this suggests that we should try to understand Genesis 1, primarily, as the first chapter of the book of Genesis. The book of Genesis has one message, and Genesis 1 is part of that. I've tried to summarise the message of Genesis 1 in this way: <em>Our God created and rules all things by his powerful word and according to his wise plan</em>, which hopefully emphasises some of the big themes running through the whole book.</p>
