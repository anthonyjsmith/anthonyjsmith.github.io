title: '#NAM2010 opening'
---
<p>Flew over most of GB today to Glasgow University for the <a href="http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/nam2010/">National Astronomy Meeting (NAM) 2010</a>. The opening speeches are taking place now (suppose that means I'm "live blogging" - not sure how long I'll keep it up for). We had <a href="http://www.kevinbowyer.net/">international concert organist Kevin Bowyer</a> playing the Star Wars theme on the <a href="http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/image/?id=UGSP00353">Bute Hall organ</a> as we took our seats, and important dignataries for this event have included Charles Kennedy, MP (until 5pm today, apparently, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament">Parliament will "dissolve"</a>). Here are a couple of photos, first of the University chapel</p>

<p>and then of Charles Kennedy himself (sorry, picked a bad moment - holding the camera steady was enough of a challenge!)</p>
