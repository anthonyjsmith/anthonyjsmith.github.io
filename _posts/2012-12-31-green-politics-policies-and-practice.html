title: 'Green politics: policies and practice'
---
<p>The second half of Derek Wall's <i>The No-Nonsense Guide to Green Politics</i> (<a title="Green politics: holistic politics" href="/2012/12/29/green-politics-holistic-politics/">part 1</a>) deals with the policies and practice of green politics.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4</b> looks at green approaches to economics. Greens reject the dominant obsession with economic growth: "Greens believe that ever-increasing consumption is neither possible nor desirable" (p.67). This doesn't mean they are opposed to prosperity. As an obvious example, "If goods last longer, because we don't need to replace them as often, it certainly reduces economic growth but it does not affect our prosperity" (p.73). Noteworthy in green economics is the emphasis on the <i>commons</i> and on <i>social sharing</i>. This is an alternative view of ownership to the traditional views of private ownership or state ownership. Examples include co-operatives, mutuals, car sharing schemes and open-source software.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5</b> gives a sweeping survey of green policies for all sorts of areas: energy, transport, waste, agriculture, animal welfare, social justice, housing, healthcare, democracy, warfare and development. A helpful taster of how green political principles work themselves out in particular contexts.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 6</b> looks at the practice of green politics: how, practically, can green policies be implemented? Various approaches are needed, none of which is the answer in isolation, but all of which are valuable. So, in addition to traditional political activity, the green movement is also driven by direct action, personal lifestyle changes, green approaches to business, green trade unions and a complete transformation of our beliefs and values. On this last point, "The deep politics behind both our voting decisions and the assumptions of planners and policy-makers is based on fundamental and often unconscious beliefs about our relationship to the rest of nature and to each other" (p.120).</p>
<p>In other words, the "green" vision for society is dependent on a deep change of heart.</p>
