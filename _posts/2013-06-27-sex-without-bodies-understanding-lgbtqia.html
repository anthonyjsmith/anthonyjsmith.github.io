<p>What is it that unites those people who identify as LGBT—or LGBTQIA?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.culture-making.com/about/andy_crouch/">Andy Crouch</a> answers, in <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/july-august/sex-without-bodies.html?paging=off">an excellent <em>Christianity Today</em> editorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is really only one conviction that can hold this coalition of disparate human experiences together. And it is the irrelevance of bodies—specifically, the irrelevance of biological sexual differentiation in how we use our bodies.</p>
<p>What unites the LGBTQIA coalition is a conviction that human beings are not created male and female in any essential or important way. What matters is not one's body but one's heart—the seat of human will and desire, which only its owner can know.</p></blockquote>
<p>How should Christians respond to this?</p>
<blockquote><p>Christians will have to choose between two consistent positions. One, which we believe Christians who affirm gay and lesbian unions will ultimately have to embrace, is to say that embodied sexual differentiation is irrelevant— completely, thoroughly, totally irrelevant—to covenant faithfulness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or</p>
<blockquote><p>There is one other consistent position that Christians can hold, though we will hold it at great social cost, at least for the foreseeable future: that bodies matter. Indeed, that both male and female bodies are of ultimate value and dignity—not a small thing given the continuing denigration of women around the world.</p>
<p>Indeed, that matter matters. For behind the dismissal of bodies is ultimately a gnostic distaste for embodiment in general.</p></blockquote>
