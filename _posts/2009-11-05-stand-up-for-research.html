<p><a href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=4207"><img class="alignright" title="Stand up for research" src="/assets/standup_lg1.gif" alt="Stand up for research" /></a>The UK government appears to be under the impression that it should preferentially fund scientific research that has direct economic value. This, of course, is rubbish. <em>Industry</em> should preferentially fund scientific research that has direct economic value, because, well, it has direct economic value. The government should fund scientific research that pushes the frontiers of human knowledge, regardless of the direct economic impact.</p>
