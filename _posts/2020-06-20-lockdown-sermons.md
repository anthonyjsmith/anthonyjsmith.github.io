If you're curious to see how my hair grows over the period of around 12 weeks (last haircut 20 March), then enjoy the photos below. As a bonus, you can click on them and watch a video of me preaching.

**25 March: The Self-isolation of Jesus (Mark 14:43-65)**

Jesus is deserted by his disciples. He went into self-isolation for our sake, so that we will never be isolated. See [separate post]({% post_url 2020-03-29-the-self-isolation-of-jesus %}).

**5 April: Sing hosanna! (Matthew 21:1-11)**

Even when things are looking ominous (as with Jesus approaching his crucifixion), it is still possible to rejoice.

(Sermon starts at 19:20.)

**10 April: Good Friday (Matthew 27:27-61)**

The cross says 'no' and the cross says 'yes': it is bad news, and it is good news. God invites us to respond with our 'yes' to him.

**15 April: Easter Surprise! (Mark 16:1-8)**

As we enter the tomb, preoccupied with death and practicalities, we find a message that changes everything.

**26 April: Thomas (John 20:11-29)**

We can't see Jesus (just as we can't see the coronavirus), but sometimes the things we can't see are the things we really need to pay attention to.

(Sermon starts at 24:00.)

**29 April: Christ is risen ... so what? (Acts 2:22-32)**

Jesus' resurrection really happened, and it tells us that God is in control (be reassured, repent), and that Jesus is the Messiah (so receive forgiveness).

**10 May: Standing on the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:1-11)**

Particularly when everything is being shaken up around us, we need firm foundations. So we build our lives on the gospel that Christ died and rose again (bodily).

(Sermon starts at 20:40.)

{% include facebook.html facebook_id="613388509263698" %}

**24 May: The resurrection body (1 Corinthians 15:35-58)**

It's tempting to look forward to eternity without the inconvenience of a body, but the Christian hope is for our dead bodies to be brought back to life, by God's power, and for them to be transformed and glorified, to be suitable for God's eternal kingdom.

(Sermon starts at 22:50.)

**27 May: Resurrection minded (Acts 24:1-21)**

If we set our minds on a disembodied eternal future, we will likely end up feeling disconnected from the world in which we live. But if our hope is for resurrection, then we will recognise that this world really matters.

**10 June: The Lord watches over you (Psalm 121)**

Every journey these days feels dangerous, so it is good to be reminded that the Lord who watches over us is our Creator, Redeemer, and Companion.

{% include facebook.html facebook_id="2318233355150359" %}

**14 June: Keeping connected (1 John 1:1-4)**

We know the importance of keeping connected in these days. But the most important thing is to keep connected with God, which we can do, if we are connected with Jesus Christ through the Bible.

(Sermon starts at 19:20.)
