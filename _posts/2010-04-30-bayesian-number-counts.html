<p>Here's a simple bit of statistics for a Friday lunchtime. You count the number of galaxies in a certain area on the sky (with the galaxies satisfying some specific properties, if you like). What is the <em>true</em> number density? Let the expected number be $$\lambda$$ (the true number density multiplied by the area on the sky) and the measured number be $$k$$. Then, in true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayesian</a> fashion, what we want is $$!P(\lambda|k) = \frac{P(k|\lambda)P(\lambda)}{P(k)}$$</p>
<p>Now, for the prior, $$P(\lambda)$$, we assume a prior which is flat on a logarithmic scale. That is, we guess (before making the observation) that the expected number is as likely to lie between 1 and 10 as it is to lie between 1000 and 10,000. (The alternative, a flat prior on a <em>linear</em> scale, would mean that we guess the true density is just as likely to lie between 10,001 and 10,010 as it is to lie between 1 and 10, which is ridiculous.) So $$P(\lambda) \propto 1/\lambda$$. The likelihood, $$P(k|\lambda)$$ is given by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a>.Â So, ignoring the normalizing factor of $$P(k)$$, $$!P(\lambda|k) \propto \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} e^{-\lambda} \frac{1}{\lambda}$$ $$! \propto \lambda^{k-1}e^{-\lambda}$$</p>
<p>And this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution">Gamma distribution</a>. Easy peasy.</p>
