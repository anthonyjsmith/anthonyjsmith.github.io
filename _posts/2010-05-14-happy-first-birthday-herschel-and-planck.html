<p>It's one year ago today that <em>Herschel</em> and <em>Planck</em> were propelled up into space to survey the Universe—the "cool" Universe, to be more specific—on behalf of humanity. (Of course, it wasn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel">William Herschel</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck">Max Planck</a> who were sent a million miles from the earth on top of a rocket, but rather the European Space Agency—ESA—satellites named after them.) <a href="http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM8CP19Y8G_FeatureWeek_0.html">ESA wishes them both a happy birthday on their website</a>, and there are <a href="http://herschel.cf.ac.uk/news/herschel-clocks-one-year-space">similar felicitations from the UK Herschel page</a>, both with links to the exciting results and stunning images being released.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we've been busy putting together the first results from <a href="http://hermes.sussex.ac.uk/">HerMES</a>, a major project on Herschel looking at star formation in hundreds of thousands of very distant galaxies. These were among the many results announced last week at <a href="http://www.congrex.nl/10A10/">an ESA conference in The Netherlands</a> (which included a <a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Herschel/SEMJDCHMI8G_0.html">media event</a>), and now the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-basic_connect?qsearch=herschel+hermes+2010&amp;version=1">HerMES scientific papers</a> are being made available to anyone who enjoys reading that kind of thing, and, indeed to anyone who doesn't. For mere mortals, though, the pretty pictures are on <a href="http://oshi.esa.int/">OSHI, the Online Showcase of Herschel Images</a> and on the <a href="http://herschelmission.wordpress.com/">Herschel blog</a>.</p>
