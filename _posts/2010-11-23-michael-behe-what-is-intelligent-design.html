An Evening with Michael Behe</a></em>, hosted by Justin Brierley, presenter of <a href="http://www.premier.org.uk/unbelievable">Premier Christian Radio's <em>Unbelievable? </em>programme</a>, with support from the new <a href="http://c4id.org.uk/">Centre for Intelligent Design</a>.</p>
<p>I thought I'd use that as an excuse for a series of blog posts about "Intelligent Design" (ID), as <a href="http://lehigh.edu/~inbios/faculty/behe.html">Michael Behe</a> is one of the biggest names in that movement. It's not something I know much about, but this is my blog, and what is the purpose of a blog if not to give me an outlet for my ignorant waffle? I'm just thinking aloud; don't take this too seriously.</p>
<p>So let's begin: what is ID?</p>
<p>Here's what Behe said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Design is the purposeful arrangement of parts.</p>
<p>We infer design whenever parts appear arranged to accomplish a function.</p>
<p>The strength of the inference is quantitative.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is any different to the <a href="http://www.arn.org/docs/dembski/wd_explfilter.htm">"explanatory filter" of ID proponent William Dembski</a>, which goes something like this. Can it be explained by physical laws and necessity? (No.) Can it be explained by a combination of law and chance processes? (No.) Then the reasonable inference is that an intelligent agent has been involved.</p>
<p>I've chewed over this a bit, and in an attempt to capture the thrust of ID, I offer the following as a summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>The theory of evolution by random mutation and natural selection does a pretty bad job at explaining the complexity we see in living things. So, hey guys, maybe we should try thinking up some other ideas one of these days?</p></blockquote>
<p>And since these "other ideas" would all involve the purposeful activity of an external agent, we can lump them together under the name "Intelligent Design".</p>
<p>In other words, it seems to me that ID is essentially anti-evolutionism with the addition of the (trivial) statement, that if, whenever we attempt to explain life (in all its complexity) <em>without</em> the intervention of an external intelligent agent, our attempts fail, then that suggests that an external intelligent agent might well have been involved.</p>
<p>That's not to say ID is not without value. But basically ID is anti-evolutionism.</p>
