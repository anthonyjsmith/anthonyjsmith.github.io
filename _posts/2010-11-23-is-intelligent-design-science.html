<p>Countless hours have been wasted poring over this most uninteresting, pedantic and pointless of questions. Rather than seeking to answer the questions raised by Intelligent Design (ID), certain people seem to think it is much more pressing to determine once and for all in which drawer of the filing cabinet the question should reside.</p>
<p>Enough! I don't care whether or not ID is science; I want to know whether it is true!</p>
