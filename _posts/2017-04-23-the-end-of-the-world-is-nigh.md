The great prophets of Israel prophesied at a time when the world as they knew it was collapsing. As the world as _we_ know it begins to collapse, do we need a revival of prophetic preaching?

[<img alt="The Prophetic Imagination, by Walter Brueggemann" title="The Prophetic Imagination, by Walter Brueggemann" src="/assets/brueggemann-prophetic.jpg" class="alignright" />](http://fortresspress.com/product/prophetic-imagination-revised-edition)The prophetic task is not _usually_ concerned with predicting the future. Nor does it _usually_ involve direct confrontation with the world. But it _always_ involves giving God's people a vision of a different world order. The present order of things is dying, and we need our hearts to be captivated by a vision of the coming age: the kingdom of God. This is the argument made by renowned Old Testament scholar [Walter Brueggemann](http://www.walterbrueggemann.com/) in his influential (and short!) book from 1978 (revised in 2001), [_The Prophetic Imagination_](http://fortresspress.com/product/prophetic-imagination-revised-edition). In his own summary,

> The task of prophetic ministry is to nurture, nourish, and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture around us (p. 3).

Brueggemann describes the 'dominant consciousness' (of _every_ culture) in terms of its _numbness_ and its sense of _despair_ &ndash; terms that could very easily be applied to our culture today. The numbness reflects an inability to face criticism, and the despair reflects an inability to consider fresh possibilities for the future:

> I suggest that the dominant culture, now and in every time, is grossly uncritical, cannot tolerate serious and fundamental criticism, and will go to great lengths to stop it. Conversely, the dominant culture is a wearied culture, nearly unable to be seriously energized to new promises from God (p. 4).

First, the prophetic preacher will seek to **criticise** the dominant culture. This is done through 'anguish and not anger' (p. 81), following the example of Jeremiah, in order to penetrate the culture's numbness. Only when we are able to grieve in the face of the deathliness of the culture around us will we be free to receive the promise of something new. 'Blessed are you that weep now, for you shall laugh' (Lk 6:21, p. 118).

Second, the prophetic preacher will seek to **energise** with a vision of God's promises for the future. This is a matter of 'hope and not optimism' (p. 101), relying on God's sovereign and surprising intervention. With our imaginations shaped by visions such as those in Isaiah 40-55, despair turns to amazement, joy, and praise.

The end of the world is nigh! Perhaps not the _final_ end. But just as every imperial reality in the past has fallen, however unshakeable it may have seen at the time, so the empire that we live in will also come to an end. I don't know when that will be. Perhaps soon? Perhaps in stages? Perhaps it has already begun? But I'm sure it will happen.

The problem is that, as Christians in the West, we don't _want_ it to end. We actually rather like &ndash; or even [love]({% post_url 2012-09-10-how-to-become-a-better-lover %}) &ndash; the empire, and all that it gives us: material prosperity, individual autonomy, pleasure, security. And when God's judgment falls on this Western empire, as it surely will, it is right that we should lament and grieve at its downfall. But that's a process we need to begin _now_, _before_ we are forced to choose which we genuinely love: the empire of the West, or the empire of God.

> So be it, Lord; thy throne shall never,\\
> like earth's proud empires, pass away;\\
> thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever,\\
> till all thy creatures own thy sway.
