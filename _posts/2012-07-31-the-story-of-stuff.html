<p>I've been watching some, erm, stuff from <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.org/">The Story of Stuff Project</a>. It's about our patterns of production and consumption, and how they are all messed up. Here's the original movie from 2007, <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.org/movies-all/story-of-stuff/"><em>The Story of Stuff</em></a>, which <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.org/about/">claims</a> to be "one of the most watched environmental-themed online movies of all time". You can help that to remain the case by watching it now...</p>
