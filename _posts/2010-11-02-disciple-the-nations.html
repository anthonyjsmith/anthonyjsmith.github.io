<blockquote>The <a href="http://www.esvonline.org/mt28:18-20/">commission</a> is not to "make disciples" in our modern individualistic sense. That is included, and amen to it. But the commission as the Lord worded it says that we are to <span style="font-style: normal;">disciple the nations</span>. To say that cultural transformation is not part of this is to completely overlook the direct object of that verb. We are to disciple the <span style="font-style: normal;">ethnoi</span>, their hearts, souls, and minds, but also their court systems, and their film industries, and their politics, and their art studios, and their publishing industries. This certainly means discipling their citizens, and we <span style="font-style: normal;">start</span><em> </em>with that. But it is just the beginning.</p></blockquote>
