<p style="text-align: justify;">By day, I <a href="http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/about/">work</a> in computer software. Previously I was a university researcher in astronomy, but that drifted towards astronomical computer software, and now I'm mainly doing freelance web development. I also spend a fair bit of time trying to support Christian postgraduate students in Liverpool and elsewhere (partly through involvement in <a href="http://wysocs.org.uk/faith-in-scholarship">Faith-in-Scholarship</a> and <a href="http://christianpostgrad.org.uk/content/node/34">Transforming the Mind</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I bought this domain name back in 2002, and haven't yet persuaded myself to give it up. Initially it was just a few static (and tasteless) HTML pages with a bit about myself and lots of links, but <a title="Ceci n'est pas un blog" href="/2006/04/24/ceci-nest-pas-un-blog/">it became a non-blog on 24 April 2006</a> (using WordPress). I don't have a particular purpose for the (non-)blog, but I enjoy writing from time to time, and I like to delude myself into thinking that I have something worthwhile to say. I tend to focus on Christian-related topics, but you'll see occasional posts about astronomy, computing, music, green issues, politics, current affairs, random thoughts and random trivia. (Posts of a more technical nature related to astronomy or computing can be found <a href="http://www.enkaptic.co.uk/">on my other blog</a>.) Comments welcome, unless you're a spambot!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite having been in church services most weeks for all of my life, by the time I was ten I was a firm atheist and thought this religious stuff was a load of nonsense. But I think I wanted to believe, not least because I was getting very keen on church music and playing the organ. When I was 15 I started going to the youth group of a local Bible-believing church. On 2 March 1996 this church held a youth service. The preacher's text was Luke 9:23: "Then he [Jesus] said to them all: 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.' " He encouraged us to commit our lives to God, and I did so, out of a real sense of God drawing me to himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was quite a radical change, and I now see my life as fitting into God's big story for his whole creation, which is summed up nicely in <a href="http://three-two-one.org/">this video</a> (embedded below).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's been a varied journey since that time. Some significant influences on my thinking and spiritual formation, in approximately chronological order, have included: Hitchin Christian Centre, Evangelical Times, Answers in Genesis/Creation Ministries International and Ken Ham, John Stott, Francis Schaeffer, CH Spurgeon, CICCU and UCCF, Cambridge Presbyterian Church and Ian Hamilton, Roger Carswell, <a href="http://www.calvary-brighton.org.uk/">Calvary Evangelical Church (Brighton)</a> and Philip Wells, <a href="http://www.labri.org/">L'Abri</a> (England) and Andrew Fellows, Proclamation Trust and Dick Lucas, Larry Crabb, Graeme Goldsworthy, Christopher Wright, Ellis Potter, Mike Reeves, <a href="http://www.ntwrightpage.com/">NT Wright</a>, Word Alive, John Piper, David Field, Henri Blocher, Kurt Wise, <a href="http://www.jubilee-centre.org/">Jubilee Centre</a>, <a href="http://www.allofliferedeemed.co.uk/basden.htm">Andrew Basden</a>, Roy Clouser, Al Wolters, <a href="http://wysocs.org.uk/">WYSOCS</a> (West Yorkshire School of Christian Studies), Jonathan Chaplin, Stephen Neill, Bob Goudzwaard, James KA Smith, Peter Leithart ... and more!</p>
