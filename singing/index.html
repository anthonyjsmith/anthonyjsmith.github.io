<h3><a name="biography"></a>Biography</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anthony Smith started singing as a boy chorister in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, and proceeded to learn the organ to a high standard. He began to take singing seriously only when offered free singing lessons on his arrival as an Organ Scholar at Cambridge in 1999. During his time at Jesus College he had lessons with Suzanne Flowers and Geoffrey Davidson, and sang as a soloist in Haydn's <em>Nelson Mass </em>and Zelenka's <em>Lamentations</em>. He was also a member of <em>Les Joly Boys</em>, an ensemble specializing in early secular vocal music.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On moving to Brighton in 2002 Anthony began studying with Charles Corp in Worthing. Recent performances have included Handel's <em>Messiah</em> in Hitchin and Worthing, Bach's <em>St Matthew Passion</em> (Christus) in Wandsworth and, with the Worthing Philharmonic Choir, Haydn's <em>Creation</em>, <em>Nelson Mass</em> and <em>Harmoniemesse</em> and Mozart's <em>Mass in C Minor</em>. He has also sung regularly with the BREMF SIngers and the <a href="http://www.bremf.org.uk/consort/RHShomeBCV.htm">BREMF Consort of Voices</a>, both linked with the <a href="http://www.bremf.org.uk/">Brighton Early Music Festival (BREMF)</a>.</p>
